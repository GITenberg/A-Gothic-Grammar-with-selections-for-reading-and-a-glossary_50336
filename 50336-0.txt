AUTHOR'S PREFACE.


The main object of this Gothic Grammar is to render service to academic
instruction, as a basis for lectures and Gothic exercises; it is
intended, at the same time, to afford the student sufficient aid in
acquiring a practical knowledge of the Gothic language and thus enable
him to follow more advantageously the lectures on historical and
comparativ grammar. For this purpose the Gothic Fonology and Inflection
ar, as far as possibl, set forth by themselves, without resorting
to Comparativ Grammar for an explanation of the facts. Occasionally
another Germanic dialect, as the Old High German, has rather been
referd to. The linguistic elucidation is left to the lectures. To him,
however, who lerns Gothic from this book, without any possibility
of hearing lectures, wishing at the same time to gain profounder
knowledge, there may be especially recommended the following helps: K.
BRUGMANN'S 'Grundriss der vergleichenden grammatik' and FR. KLUGE'S
'Vorgeschichte der altgermanischen dialekte' (in PAUL'S 'Grundriss der
germ. philologie', I, 300-406).

The references to literary works containd in the Grammar itself ar not
intended to act as linguistic explanations, but refer to works and
treatises which present much of profit concerning the establishment
and conception of facts from a purely Gothic point of view; several
references to BRUGMANN'S 'Grundriss' ar perhaps the only exceptions.

The Reading Exercises ar intended to offer sufficient material for
Gothic exercises; they giv students working independently of a teacher
an opportunity to apply what they hav lernd from the Grammar. The
beginner may be advized at first simply to read over the chapters on
Fonology, but to giv more attention to those on Inflection (for the
beginning without the notes) and then to commence reading a text. This
exercise ought to be accumpanied by a more extended lerning of the
Grammar, just as a thuro analysis of the text wil require a constant
reference to the Grammar.

The Glossary contains not only the vocabulary of the Reading Exercises,
but also all words occurring in the Grammar. The citations from the
Inflection hav been givn in ful, those from the Fonology in every case
where a word is not givn merely as an arbitrary chozen exampl. Thus the
Glossary may at the same time serv as an Index to the Grammar.

Sinse its first appearance in 1880, this book has not undergone
essential changes; the success seemd to me to garantee the
appropriateness of the plan, so that also in the present edition I hav
not complied with several wishes for a farther scope. I stil hold that
an admixture of elements from Comparativ Filology would be opposed to
the object of the book. The question could rather arize as to whether
there ought not to be added any chapters on Word-Formation and Syntax
as main parts to the Fonology and Inflection. However this also has
been disregarded. Such points of word-formation as may promote the
practical study of the Gothic language, wil be found interwoven in
the Inflection; a systematic presentation of the Gothic alone does
not seem to me to prove very beneficial, but only in connection with
the other Germanic, resp. Indo-Germanic, languages. And particularly
with respect to this, excellent assistance is afforded the student by
KLUGE's 'Nominale stammbildungslehre der altgermanischen dialekte'
(cp. § 223) which has been amply referd to under Inflection, and which
is easily accessibl as a supplementary number to the 'Sammlung kurzer
grammatiken germanischer dialekte'. The addition of a syntax in harmony
with the rest of the grammar would likely hav increast the book to dubl
its size, which, as regards its sale, seemd to me a point wurthy of
consideration. There are, moreover, easily attainabl summaries of the
Gothic language. Therefore I hav for the present contented myself with
annexing a list of grammatical and lexical helps (§ 224), which may
serv as a guide to the inquirer.

For this edition I hav again receivd kind informations from sum that
uze the book. Beside the correction of misprints, the contents of the
book has been favorably influenced by notes receivd from Mssrs. G. H.
Balg, R. Bethge, J. Franck, and M. H. Jellinek. I herewith express my
sincerest thanks to all. Mr. Roediger's review has also been thankfully
uzed. For assistance renderd me in correcting the proof-sheets, I ow
many thanks to my friend E. Sievers.

EDITOR'S PREFACE.


The present edition contains all of the latest (fourth) German edition
and such additional matter as has been deemd fit to enable the student
to lern Gothic more quickly than he would without it. The addition of
the Explanatory Notes and of the comprehensiv amplification of the
Glossary has, in a mezure, been suggested and desired by many. At first
it was intended to ad explanatory notes only, leaving the glossary
intact. But from numerous communications I lernd that the present
glossary must be welcum to many, if not all, students of Gothic.

In writing down the Notes I hav taken great pains to place myself in
the position of the beginner, and it is hoped that the more advanced
student wil pardon what might seem superfluous to him. Sum of the
explanations ar due to Bernhardt's critical notes in his 'Wulfila'
to which I hav often referd. The Notes wer much more comprehensiv
before the glossary was workt out, but many of them hav been transferd
to the latter, in a few cases without being deleted in their first
place, as I observd in reading the proof-sheets. The Glossary has
been prepared upon the following plan: It is strictly alfabetic. The
compound verbs ar mentiond with the simpl verbs. Many inflectional
forms which the beginner who has not yet fully masterd the declensions
and conjugations, is not likely to recognize in the texts, hav been
givn as vocabulary words. The inflection of every word is indicated
by figures in parentheses. The figures in () immediately after the
vocabulary words refer to the paragrafs on Fonology. Proper nouns hav
been inflected in full inasmuch as they occur in the Selections. The
references to the texts ar complete and may be regarded as the first
supplement to my 'Comparativ Glossary of the Gothic Language'. Tho
admitting accidental omissions in this respect, I am certain that the
references ar more complete than those of any other glossary. This
tiresum work has cost me much time and labor, but I hope soon to be
able to continue and complete it for the remaining part of the Gothic
texts.

In the square brackets the derivation of the Gothic words is givn
first; then follow the correspondences or cognates, both being, with
one or two exceptions, Germanic. The cognates ar always preceded by cp.
or cf. It is possibl, however, that I hav faild in sum cases to point
out the transference of a word from one declension or conjugation to
another.

This part of the book makes no claim to completeness. Several articls
had been laid aside for further consideration, but professional and
other duties as wel as the sudden appearance of the German edition
ar the causes of leaving them untucht. As regards derivation and
composition, the student wil do wel by reading carefully §§ 79-82 and §
88ᵃ together with the notes. To point out the various root-grades from
which words are derived, is left to the lecturer.

The translation of the Grammar was made from the advanced plate proofs
for which I am obliged to the eminent author, Prof. Wm. Braune, who
kindly and promptly forwarded them to me. Altho this part of the
work was done as fast as it was demanded by the printer, I feel sure
that nothing has been omitted. In this respect I am indetted to my
wife and one of my pupils, Miss Matilda Uihlein who, in comparing my
translation with the German text, red the latter from the beginning to
the end. Another pupil, Miss Ida Uihlein, is to be credited for the
translation of Prof. Braune's preface, which could be sent to press
with comparativly few emendations.

Beside the books often cited in the square brackets and in the Notes
I have thankfully uzed Mayhew and Skeat's Midl English Dictionary,
Skeat's Etymological Dictionary, and Mac Lean's Old and Midl English
Reader.

CHAP. I. THE ALFABET.


§ 1. The monuments of the Gothic language ar handed down to us in a
peculiar alfabet which, according to Greek ecclesiastic writers, was
invented by Wulfila (s. § 221). The Gothic alfabet, however, is not
entirely a new creation, but Wulfila based it on the Greek alfabet
which he accomodated to the Gothic sounds, increasing it by several
signs from the Latin alfabet, and, in a few cases, availing himself
of the familiar runic alfabet. Of the Greek alfabet he also retaind
the order and numerical value. The Gothic alfabet is now sufficiently
represented in Roman letters. In the following we giv in the first line
the original Gothic characters, in the second their numerical values,
in the third the transliteration of the Gothic characters by Roman
letters, which latter we shall uze exclusivly in this book.

   r    s    t    w    f    χ    ƕ    o    --]

  NOTE 1. Of these signs one (=i=, _10_) is represented by two forms.
  The =i= without dots occurs oftener, the =i= with dots stands at
  the beginning of a word, and in the midl of a word after a vowel,
  to show that it forms a syllabl for itself and does not form a
  difthong with the preceding vowel; e. g., =fraïtiþ= (= =fra-itiþ=).
  In transliteration =i= is employd thruout.

  NOTE 2. Two characters, the Greek episema 'koppa' (_90_) and
  'sampi' (_900_), hav no fonetic values, but serv only as numerals.
  When the symbols denote numerals, they ar markt by a horizontal
  stroke abuv them, or by dots before and after them: =i̅b̅= or
  =·ib·= = 12.

  NOTE 3. The transliteration of the Gothic symbols is not alike in
  all cases. Most editors hav hitherto uzed =v= for =w= (§ 39, n. 1);
  for the singl symbols =q= (§ 39, n. 1) and =ƕ= (§ 63) we find =kv=
  or =qu= and =hv= or =w=, respectivly; for =þ=, which is borrowd
  from the Norse-A.-S. alfabet, also =th= occurs (§ 70, n. 1).

  NOTE 4. The Gothic monuments show but few abbreviations; the holy
  names, =guþ=, =frauja=, =iêsus=, =Χristus=, ar always abbreviated.
  Abbreviations ar denoted by a stroke abuv the word, but in our
  texts the abbreviated words ar uzually printed in ful; as, =g̅þ̅= =
  =guþ=, =f̅a̅=, =f̅i̅n̅s̅= = =frauja=, =fraujins=.--For more on this
  point, s. Gabelentz-Loebe's grammar, p. 19 et seq.

  NOTE 5. The Goths alredy had the Germanic runic letters before
  Wulfila. The names of these letters wer uzed also for the new
  characters. The names of the Gothic symbols, together with a
  few Gothic words and alfabets, ar preservd in a Salzburg-Vienna
  manuscript of the 9th century: W. Grimm, 'Wiener Jahrbücher der
  Litteratur 43', p. 4 et seq. Massmann, zs. fda. 1, p. 296 et
  seq.--The form of the names, however, is very corrupt. As to
  this, cp. A. Kirchhoff, 'Das Gotische Runenalphabet', 2nd edit.,
  Berlin 1854; J. Zacher, 'Das Gotische Alphabet Vulfilas und das
  Runenalphabet', Leipzig 1855.--Of special importance is Wimmer's
  treatis on Wulfila's alfabet, as 'Appendix I' to his book: 'Die
  Runenschrift', Berlin 1887, pp. 259-274.

§ 2. Of the 27 characters two hav only numerical values, (§ 1, n. 2), a
third, the χ, is retaind only in Greek foren words, especially in the
name 'Christus', and denotes no Gothic sound. Hense there remain the
following 24 characters whose fonetic values ar to be determind:

(a) Consonants:

  =p b f m w | t d þ s z n l r | k q g h ƕ j.=

(b) Vowels:

  =a e i o u.=

(c) Difthongs:

  =ei iu ai au.=

In determining the fonetic values of these characters we ar guided
by the following means: (1) The Gothic alfabet is based on the Greek
alfabet; hense, the pronunciation of the Greek letters to be determind
for the 4th century, must also be regarded as that of the Gothic
letters so long as there is no proof to the contrary. (2) The rendition
of the numerous Greek foren words and proper nouns by Wulfila. (3)
The transliteration of the Gothic proper nouns in Latin documents
and by Latin authors of the 4th-8th centuries. (4) The testimony of
the cognate Germanic languages. (5) Fonetic changes and grammatical
fenomena in the Gothic language itself permit us to draw conclusions
about the nature of the sounds.

  NOTE 1. Concerning the pronunciation of the Gothic letters, cp.
  Weingärtner, 'Die Aussprache des Gotischen zur Zeit des Ulfilas',
  Leipzig 1858; Fr. Dietrich, 'Ueber die Aussprache des Gotischen
  während der Zeit seines Bestehens', Marburg 1862; about the
  consonants, Paul, 'Zur Lautverschiebung', Beitr. 1, p. 147 et seq.

  NOTE 2. An old testimony for the Gothic pronunciation in the
  Salzburg-Vienna MS.:

  _uuortun  otan   auar  euangeliū   ther   lucam_
  =waurþun  uþþan  afar  aiwaggeljo  þairh  Lokan=

      _uuorthun  auar  thuo  iachuedant iachᵘatun_
      =waurþun   afar  þo    jah qeþun.=

  alia his sim̅ ubi aspiratione . ut dicitur gah libeda _jah libaida_
      diptongon _ai_ pro e longa    p ch _q_ ponunt.--Cp. § 1, n. 5,
  and, for explanation, especially Kirchhoff, p. 20 et seq.




CHAP. II. THE VOWELS.


a

§ 3. The Gothic =a= signifies as a rule the short a-sound [as in G.
mann].

  NOTE 1. Foren words and names; as, =Annas=, Ἀννας; =Akaja=, Ἀχαΐα;
  =barbarus=, βάρβαρος; =aggilus=, ἄγγελος; =karkara=, _carcer_;
  =lukarn=, _lucerna_; =Kafarnaum=, Καπερναούμ.

  NOTE 2. Gothic names: =Athanaricus=, =Ariaricus=, =Amalafrigda=
  (_Ammian._)

§ 4. Short =a= is very frequent both in stem-syllabls and in
inflection. E. g.

(a) Stem-syllabls: =agis=, _aw_; =aljis=, '_alius_'; =tagr=, _tear_;
=aƕa=, '_aqua_'; =alan=, _to grow_; =hafjan=, _to heav_; =saltan=, _to
salt_; =haldan=, _to hold_; =waldan=, _to rule_; =fadar=, _father_;
=staþs=, _place_.--=ahtau=, '_octo_'; =gasts=, _guest_; =ƕaþar=,
'_uter_'; =awistr=, _sheepfold_ (OHG. au, '_ovis_'; ahd. gr., § 219, n.
3); =bandi=, _band_; =barn=, _child_; =saggws=, _song_; all preterits
of the III.-V. ablaut-series: =bar=, _I bore_; =hlaf=, _I stole_;
=band=, _I bound_; =gaf=, _I gave_, etc.

(b) Inflections: =daga= (dat. sg., § 90), =waúrda= (nom. acc. pl., §
93), =giba= (nom. acc. sg., § 96), =guma= (nom. sg., § 107), =haírtôna=
(nom. acc. pl., § 109); --=blindamma=, =blindana=, =blinda=, =blindata=
(str. adj., § 123); --=imma=, =ina=, =ita=, =ija=, =meina= (prn.; § 150
et seq.); --=nima= (1st pers. sg. prs. ind.); =nimaima=, =nimaiwa=,
=nimaina= (1st pers. pl. du. and 3d pers. pl. opt., § 170); =haitada=
(medio-passiv, § 170); =sôkida= (weak prt., § 184); --adverbs: =-ba=
(as, =glaggwuba=), =nêƕa=, =inna=, =ana=, =waíla=, etc.

  NOTE 1. Apocope of an unaccented =a= before enclitics:
  =þat-ist=, =þat-ei=, =þan-uh=, =þamm-uh=, =þan-ei=, =þamm-ei=,
  =kar-ist=.--Also =frêt= and =frêtum= (prt. of =fra-itan=, _to
  devour_, § 176, n. 3).

  NOTE 2. For =a= in the difthongs =ai=, =au=, s. §§ 21. 25.

§ 5. In a few cases =a= is long [as in E. father]. (Comp. Holtzmann,
Altd. Gr., I, 3 et seq.).

(a) In foren words: =Silbânus= (_Silvanus_), =aurâli= (_orale_),
=spaíkulâtur= (_speculator_), =Peilâtus=, etc.;

(b) In the following Gothic words: =fâhan= (OHG. fâhan), _to cach_;
=hâhan= (OHG. hâhan), _to hang_; =þâhta= (prt. of =þagkjan=, _to
think_); =brâhta= (prt. of =briggan=, _to bring_); =gafâhs=, _a haul_;
=faúrhâh=, _curtain_; =gahâhjô=, _in order_; =-gâhts=, _a going_; also
=þâhô= (OHG. dâha), _clay_; =unwâhs=, _blameless_ (OE. wôh, _wrong_).

  NOTE. In the words mentiond under (b) =âh= arose from =anh= (§ 50,
  n. 1). Cp. also Litbl. 1886, p. 485.


e

§ 6. =e= is always a long, close vowel (=ê=) approaching very much the
sound of =i= [as in E. they].

  NOTE 1. In Greek words η is regularly represented by =ê=; e.
  g., =Gabriêl=, =Kêfas=, =aíkklêsjô=, =Krêta=; --sumtimes also
  ι: =Naên=, Ναίν; =Tykêkus=, Τυχικός; =aíloê=, ἐλωί; likewise e:
  =Jarêd=, Ἰαρέδ.

  NOTE 2. In Gothic names Latin writers employ =e= for Gothic =ê=:
  =Sigismêres=, =Gelimêr=, =Reccarêd=; besides, as erly as the 6th
  century, quite regularly also =i=; as, =Theodemir=, =Valamir=. Cp.
  Beitr., 11, 7 et seq.; Wrede, Wand., 92 et seq. #/Ναίν

§ 7. Goth. =ê= (which regularly corresponds to OHG. and OS. â; ahd.
gr., § 34) is found:

(a) in reduplicating verbs, in part with the ablaut =ô= (§§ 179.
181): =grêtan=, =lêtan=, =slêpan=; (b) in the prt. pl. of the IV.
and V. ablaut-series: =sêtum= (inf. =sitan=, _to sit_), =nêmun= (inf.
=niman=, _to take_), =têmum= (inf. =timan=, _to befit_), =êtum= (inf.
_itan_), and in the prt. sg. =frêt=; Luc. XV, 30 (§ 176, n. 3); (c)
in derivativs from the verbal stems givn under (b); as, =andanêms=,
_agreeabl_; =andanêm=, _a receiving_; =gatêmiba=, _becumingly_;
=uzêta=, _manger_; (d) in other words; as, =jêr=, _year_; =qêns=,
_wife_; =mêna=, _moon_; =lêkeis=, _fysician_; =mêrjan=, _to preach_;
=manasêþs= ('_man-seed_'), _world_, etc.; (e) in formativ syllabls:
=fahêþs=, _joy_; =awêþi=, _flock of sheep_ (cp. however § 17, n. 1);
=azêts=, _easy_; 2nd pers. sg. prt. of wvs., =-dês= (=nasidês=, § 184);
(f) final: in the ending of the gen. pl.; as, =dagê=; in monosyllabic
instrumentals: =þê=, =ƕê= (§§ 153. 159); in particls and advs.; as,
=swê=, =untê=, =hidrê=, =bisunjanê=; lastly, in the dativs =ƕammêh=,
=ƕarjammêh=, =ainummê-hun= (cp. §§ 163-166).

  NOTE 1. =ê= before vowels appears as =ai=; s. § 22.

  NOTE 2. =ei= occurs quite often for =ê=, especially in the Gospel
  of St. Luke; as, =qeins= (= =qêns=), =faheid= (= =fahêd=),
  =fraleitais= (= =fralêtais=); Lu. II, 5. 10. 29; =afleitan=; Mt.
  IX, 6, etc.

  NOTE 3. Sporadically also =i= for =ê=; so, frequently, in the
  Gospel of St. Lu.; as, =b~i~rusjôs=; Lu. II, 41; =q~i~þeina=; VIII,
  56. IX, 21; =tawid~i~deina=; VI, 11; =duatsn~i~wun=; Mk. VI, 53.
  Only =i= is found in =wriþus=, _herd_; Lu. VIII, 33 (for =wrêþus=;
  cp. Bezzenb. Beitr. 3, 114).

  NOTE 4. Reversely, also =e= occurs for =i= and =ei= (§ 10, n. 5; §
  17, n. 1).--These deviations (in ns. 2-4) seem due to East Gothic
  writers; cp. Wrede, 'Ostg.', 161.

§ 8. From the preceding =ê= must be separated the =ê= of sum Gothic
words in which it corresponds to OHG. ea, ia (not â): =hêr=, _here_;
=Krêks=, _Greek_; =fêra=, _side_, _region_; =mês=, _table_. Cp. ahd.
gr., §§ 35. 36; Beitr., 18, 409 et seq.


i

§ 9. Gothic =i=, as a rule, denotes the short vowel =i= [as in E. it],
while its corresponding long sound is represented by =ei= [= ie in E.
believ]; s. § 16.

  NOTE 1. The =i= in Greek words stands for short ι, only
  exceptionally for η which is generally represented by =ê=; e. g.,
  =Aúnisimus=, Ὀνήσιμος; =Biþania=, Βηθανία.

  NOTE 2. =i= in Gothic words is long, when it is incorrectly employd
  for =ê= (cp. § 7, n. 3).

§ 10. The Gothic =i=, from an historical point of view, is of two
kinds: It represents two originally distinct sounds which, from a
purely Gothic standpoint, can not be separated.

(a) Goth. =i= = proethnic Germanic e (OHG. ë or i; cp. ahd. gr., §§
28-30), as in the prs. tense of verbs of the III.-V. ablaut-series
(§§ 32-34): =niman=, OHG. nëman; =giban=, OHG. gëban; =giba=, OHG.
gëba; =bindan=, OHG. bintan; =itan=, _to eat_; =midjis=, '_medius_';
=hlifan=, _to steal_; =swistar=, OHG. swëster; =fidwôr=, _four_;
=gifts=, _gift_; =-qiss=, _speech_; the pps. of the V. ablaut-series:
=gibans=, =itans=, =lisans=, =wigans=, =qiþans=.

(b) Goth. =i= = proethnic Germanic i (OHG. i; ahd. gr., § 31); e. g.,
=lists=, _stratagem_; =fisks=, _fish_; =is=, _he_; =wissa=, _I knew_;
=skritnan=, _to rend_ (intr.); prt. pl. and pp. of the verbs of the
I. ablaut-series (§ 30): =bitun=, =bitans= (inf. =beitan=); =stigun=,
=stigans= (inf. =steigan=); =liþun=, =liþans= (inf. =leiþan=).

  NOTE 1. Final =i= occurs in =ni=, =bi=, =si=, =hiri=; in the
  nominativs of feminin and neuter =j=-stems: =bandi= (§ 96), =kuni=
  (§ 93); in the acc. and voc. sg. of the masculin =j=-stems: =hari=
  (§ 90); 3d pers. sg. prt. opt.: =nêmi=. This final =i= appears as
  =j=, when it becums medial (§ 45).

  NOTE 2. Final =i= before a following =i= of an enclitic word
  is elided in =nist= (= =ni-ist=), =sei= (= =si-ei=), =niba= (=
  =ni-iba=).

  NOTE 3. Every =i= before =h= and =r= is broken to =aí=; cp. § 20.

  NOTE 4. =ij= is found in =ija=, '_eam_'; =þrija=, '_tria_';
  =fijan=, _to hate_; =frijôn=, _to luv_; =sijum=, _we ar_; =kijans=,
  _germinated_, etc. =i= for =ij= is rare: =fian=, =sium=, etc., but
  =friaþwa= (beside =frijaþwa=), _luv_, occurs very often.

  NOTE 5. Occasionally =e= takes the place of =i=; as, =usdrebi=; Mk.
  V, 10; =seneigana=; I. Tim. V, 1.

  NOTE 6. For =i= in the difthong =iu=, s. §§ 18. 19.

  NOTE 7. For a separation of the two =i=s (= OHG. ë and i) in East
  Gothic names, s. Wrede, 'Ostg.', 162.


o

§ 11. The Gothic character =o= always denotes a long close =o=
approaching sumwhat the sound of =û= (= o in E. home).

  NOTE 1. In Greek words =o=, as a rule, corresponds to ω, rarely to
  ο; e. g., =Makidonja=, Μακεδονία; it also stands for ου: =Iodas=,
  Ἰούδας; Lu. III, 26.

  NOTE 2. =o= in Gothic words often stands for (short) =u= (§ 14, n.
  3).

§ 12. =ô= (= OHG. uo; s. ahd. gr., § 38 et seq.) is frequent in Gothic
words. E. g., =brôþar=, _brother_; =bôka=, _beech_; =frôþs=, _wise_;
=flôdus=, _flud_; =fôtus=, _foot_.

In the prt. of the VI. series (§ 35) and of the =ê--ô=-series (§ 36):
=ôl=, =hôf=, =ôg=, pl. =ôlum=, =hôfum=, =ôgum=; =laílôt=, =laílôtum,
aísô=. In endings, as in nom. pl. =gibôs=, =dagôs=; wvs. II.: =salbôn=;
final, in gen. pl. f. =gibô=, =tuggônô=; nom. sg. =tuggô=, =haírtô=.
Prns.: =ƕô=, =þô=, =sô=, =ƕanô-h=, =ainnô-hun=, =ƕarjanô-h=. Verb
=salbô=. Advs. in =-ô= (§ 211).

  NOTE 1. For =ô= we sumtimes find =u=: =gakrôtûda= (inf. =krôtôn=),
  _he is crusht_; Lu. XX, 18; =ûhtêdun= (prs. =ôg=), _they feard_;
  Mk. XI, 32.--In East Gothic names =u= often takes the place of =ô=;
  s. Wrede, 'Ostg.', 164.

  NOTE 2. In a few words =ô= before vowels becums =au=; s. § 26.

  NOTE 3. =ô= and =u= interchange in the inflection of =fôn=, gen.
  =funins= (§ 118). Concerning this and other relations between =ô=
  and =u=, cp. Beitr. 6, 377 et seq.; 564; also Kuhns Zs., 26, 16 et
  seq.


u

§ 13. The letter =u= in Gothic denotes both a short and a long vowel;
the short =u=, however, occurs oftener than long =û=.

  NOTE 1. =u= in foren words regularly represents Gr. ου. In
  unaccented syllabls, however, it stands for Gr. ο: =diabulus=,
  διάβολος (beside =diabaúlus=), =apaústulus= (beside =apaústaúlus=),
  =paíntêkustê=, πεντηκοστή.

  NOTE 2. =u= for =ô= seldom (§ 12, n. 1), =u= for =áu= (§ 25, n. 3).

§ 14. Short =u= is very frequent in Gothic. E. g.

(a) =juk=, _yoke_; =sunus=, _sun_; =drus=, _fall_; =us-drusts=, _a
falling_; =fra-lusts=, _lost_; =lusnan=, _to perish_; --in the prt.
pl. and pp. of the verbs of the II. series (§ 31); e. g., =gutum=,
=gutans=; =lusum=, =lusans=; --in endings of the sbs. of the =u=-decl.:
=handus=, =handu=; --final, as in =þu=, prn., _thou_; =nu=, _now_; =-u=
(interr. particl).

(b) =wulfs=, _wolf_; =wulla=, _wool_; =gaqumþs=, _council_; =gulþ=,
_gold_; =swumfsl=, _pond_; =hund=, _100_; =sibun=, _7_; =taíhun=, _10_;
=fulls=, _ful_; =un-= (privativ prefix); in the prt. pl. and pp. of the
verbs of the III. series (§ 32): =bundum=, =bundans=; in the pp. of the
verbs of the IV. series (§ 33): =numans=, =stulans=.

=brukans=, _broken_; =us-bruknan=, _to break off_ (intr.); =trudan=,
_to tred_, pp. =trudans=; =snutrs=, _wise_.

  NOTE 1. As a rule, the final =u= of stems is dropt before derivativ
  =j=-suffixes; e. g., =-hardjan=, _to harden_ (< =hardus=);
  =-agljan=, _to trubl_ (< =aglus=); =manwjan=, _to prepare_ (<
  =manwus=); =ufarassjan=, _to increase_ (< =ufarassus=); L. Meyer,
  'Got. Spr.', p. 325 et seq. But =skadwjan=, _to overshadow_
  (< =skadus=), and =skadweins=, _a shading_ (cp. Zs. fda. 36,
  269).--Concerning =u= beside =w=, cp. § 42.

  NOTE 2. Every =u= before =h= and =r= is broken to =aú=; cp. § 24.

  NOTE 3. =u= is eight times (mostly in Lu.) represented by =o=; e.
  g., =laúhm~o~ni=, _lightning_: Lu. XVII, 24; =sunj~o~s=, _suns_;
  Lu. XVI, 8; =ushôf~o~n=; Lu. XVII, 13; =ain~o~mêhun=; Lu. VIII, 43;
  =faíh~o~=, _muney_; Mk. X, 23.

  NOTE 4. In the endings of the =u=-declension =u= is occasionally
  represented by =au=; as, =sunaus= (nom. sg.); Lu. IV, 3; cp. § 105,
  n. 2.

§ 15. Long =û= certainly appears in: (a) =ût=, _out_ (=ûta=, etc.);
=dûbô=, _duv_; =rûna=, _mystery_; =rûms=, _room, roomy_; =*mûl= (in
=faúrmûljan=, _to muzl_); =brûþs=, _bride_; =hûs=, _house_; =skûra=,
_shower_; =hlûtrs=, _pure_; =fûls=, _foul_; =*mûks= (in =mûkamôdei=),
_meek_; =þûsundi=, _1000_; =brûkjan=, _to uze_ (prt. =brûhta=; adj.
=brûks=); =lûkan=, _to lock_ (§ 173, n. 2); =hrûkjan=, _to crow_ (s.
Beitr., 6, 379); =hnûþô=, _sting_ (Icel. hnúþa; s. Noreen, Nord. revy,
April 1883).

(b) for nasalized =u=, the primitiv nasal being lost (cp. § 5, b; § 50,
n. 1): =þûhta= (prt. of =þugkjan=, _to think_), =þûhtus=, _thought_
(adj. =þûhts=); =hûhrus=, _hunger_; =jûhiza= (compar. to =juggs=),
_yunger_; =ûhtwô=, _daybreak_; =ûhteigs=, =ûhtiugs=, _seasonabl_;
=bi-ûhts=, _accustomd_ (s. Brgm., I, 181).

  NOTE 1. =u= is perhaps long in: =þrûtsfill=, _leprosy_ (cp. ON.
  =þrútinn=, _swoln_; OE. =þrûstfell=; Beitr., 9, 254); =anabûsns=,
  _commandment_ (Beitr., 9, 152 and 10, 497; Brgm., II, 287); =lûns=,
  _ransom_ (Brgm., II, 285); =sûts=, _sweet_ (OS. swôti, OE. swête;
  cp. however Kuhn's Zs., 26, 380); the suff. =-dûþs= (§ 103; cp.
  Beitr. 6, 380); =jûs=, _ye_ (§ 150; Brgm., III, 374. 398). Sum
  write also =fidûr-= and =-ûh= (cp. § 24, n. 2).

  NOTE 2. In =Rûma=, _Rome_, =Rûmôneis=, _a Roman_, =û= stands for
  the Lt. o.

  NOTE 3. =o= for =û= occurs only in =ôhteigô=; II. Tim. IV, 2 (in
  codex B, for =ûhteigô= in A).

  NOTE 4. For =û= becuming =au= before vowels, s. § 26, b.


ei

§ 16. Like Greek ει at the time of Wulfila, and in imitation of it,
Gothic =ei= denotes long =î=.

  NOTE 1. In Greek words =ei= uzually stands for ι, but also for
  =ei=, and sumtimes for η.

  NOTE 2. Concerning =ei= for Goth. =ê=, s. § 7, n. 2.

  NOTE 3. The difthongal pronunciation of =ei= suggested by J. Grimm
  is refuted also for linguistic reasons. Cp. J. Schmidt, 'Idg.
  Vocalismus', I, 485; Litbl. 1886, 485; Brgm., I, 57.

§ 17. =ei= in stem syllabls of Gothic words occurs especially in the
prs. tense of the I. series (§ 30): =beitan=, _to bite_; =steigan=,
_to mount_; =þeihan=, _to thrive_; in the inflection of these verbs it
interchanges with =ai= and =i=.

Other exampls: =ƕeila=, _time_; =eisarn=, _iron_; =leiþu=, _cider_;
=þreis=, _3_; =leihts=, _light_; =weihs=, _holy_; =skeirs=, _clear_;
pronouns: =weis=, _we_; =meins=, =þeins=, =seins=; --very often in
formativ and inflectional syllabls; as, adjs. in =-eigs= (=mahteigs=,
_mighty_); in =-eins= (=aiweins=, _eternal_); nomina actionis
in =-eins= (=laiseins=, _doctrin_); nom. and gen. sg. of the m.
=ja=-stems: =haírdeis=, _herd_; =laisareis=, _teacher_; nom. pl. of the
=i=-decl.: =gasteis=; opt. prt.: =nêmeis=; final, in feminins in =-ei=:
=managei= (§ 113); imperativs: =sôkei=, etc. (§ 186); the rel. particl
=ei= (§ 157), alone and in composition.

  NOTE 1. =ei= is quite often represented by =ê=; as =akêtis=; Mt.
  XXVII, 48; =wêhsa=; Mk. VIII, 26. 27; =akê=; Gal. II, 14; =izê=;
  Mk. IX, 1. Lu. VIII, 13. 15, etc.--Here perhaps belongs also
  =awêþi= (§ 7, e), which, however, occurs three times with =ê=: Jo.
  XVI, 16. I. Cor. IX, 7; cp. Beitr., 11, 32; 18, 286.

  NOTE 2. Onse (in =seiteina=; II. Cor. XI, 28) occurs =ei= beside
  =in= (in =sinteins=, _daily_; =sinteinô=, _always_).

  NOTE 3. Beside =gabeigs=, _rich_ (=gabei=, _riches_), which occurs
  5 times in Luke, also II. Cor. VIII, 9. Eph. II, 4 (in B), we find
  more frequently (11 times) =gabigs= (> =gabigjan=, _to enrich_;
  =gabignan=, _to grow rich_); cp. Brgm., II, 261. 271.


iu

§ 18. In the pronunciation of =iu= the stress is on the =i=, and =u= is
a consonant.

  NOTE 1. In Gothic words Latin writers render =iu= by eu, eo:
  =Theudes=, =Theudicodo=; =Theodoricus=. As to this, cp. Wrede,
  'Wand', 100 et seq.; 'Ostg.', 167.

  NOTE 2. In =sium= (§ 10, n. 4), =niu= (interr. particl = =ni-u=, §
  216) =iu= is dissyllabic, i. e. =í-ú=.

§ 19. =iu= is a normal vowel of the present tense of the II. series (§
31), and here it interchanges with the ablauts =au=, =u=: =biugan=, _to
bend_; =biudan=, _to offer_.--In other words; as, =þiuda=, _peple_;
=dius=, _animal_; =liuhaþ=, _light_; =diups=, _deep_; =siuks=, _sick_;
=niujis=, _new_; =niun=, _9_; =iup=, _upward_.--In formativ and
inflectional syllabls =iu= does not occur, except in the isolated
=ûhtiugs= (I. Cor. XVI, 12. Cp. Beitr., 12, 202).

  NOTE. In =triu=, _tree_; =qiujan=, _to quicken_, etc., =iu=
  interchanges with =iw= before an inflectional vowel: gen. =triwis=;
  prt. =qiwida=; cp. § 42.


ai

=ai= in Gothic words denotes two etymologically, and certainly also
fonetically, different sounds.

§ 20. I. +The short vowel+ =aí= [= a in E. fat]. =ai= is uzed in Gothic
to denote a short, open e[1]-sound. In this case, according to Grimm's
exampl, grammarians put an accute accent over the =i= (=aí=) in order
to distinguish it from =ái= (§ 21). Gothic =ai= corresponds to e or
i in OHG. and in the other Germanic languages. The short =e=-sound
represented by =aí= occurs:

(1) before =h= (=ƕ=) and =r=, which sounds hav caused breaking of
+every+ preceding short =i= to =e= (aí; § 10, n. 3); e. g., =aírþa=,
_erth_; =waírpan=, _to throw_; =baírhts=, _bright_; =faíhu=, _catl_;
=maíhstus=, _dung_; =raíhts=, _right_; =taíhun=, _10_; =saíƕan=, _to
see_; =þaíhum= (prt. pl. of =þeihan=, _to grow_). (2) in reduplicated
syllabls (§ 178 et seq.): =haíhald=, =aíaik=, =laílôt=, =saísô=, etc.
Cp. Osthoff, 'Zur Geschichte des Perfects', p. 276 et seq. Brugmann,
IV, 15. (3) in the conj. =aíþþau=, _or_ (= OHG. ëddo, ahd. gr. § 167,
n. 11; cp. Beitr. 12, 211); probably, also, in =waíla=, _wel_ (= OHG.
wëla, ahd. gr., § 29, n. 4), but cp. Beitr. 11, 553.

  NOTE 1. The law for the transition of =i= to =ai= before =h= and
  =r= (so-calld breaking or refraction) is almost without exception,
  and equally concerns the Germanic i in general and the Gothic =i=s
  (§ 10) in particular. The =i= before =h=, =r=, is retaind only in
  the following words: =nih=, '_neque_' (= =ni uh=), =hiri=, _(cum)
  here!_; du. =hirjats=, pl. =hirjiþ= (219); and in the isolated
  forms: =sihu=, _victory_ (cp. § 106, n. 1), =þarihis= (a probably
  corrupt form in Mt. IX, 16), adj. in gen. sg., _not fuld_ (said of
  cloth). Cp. IF. 4, 334 et seq.

  NOTE 2. +Not every+ =ai= before =h=, =r= is =aí=, but may also be
  the old difthong; e. g., =þáih= (prt. of =þeihan=, like =ráis=,
  prt. of =reisan=, but pl. =þaíhum=, like =risum=, § 30), =áih=, _I
  hav_; =áihts=, _property_; =háihs=, _one-eyd_; =fáih=, _deceit_
  (Beitr., 12, 397); =áir=, _erly_ (OHG. êr); =sáir= (OHG. sêr),
  _sorrow_; =áirus=, _messenger_. Whether =ai= has the value of
  =ái= or =aí= can in most cases only be inferd from the remaining
  Germanic languages.

  NOTE 3. In Latin orthografy =aí= is exprest by e; e. g.,
  Ermanaricus = Goth. =*Aírmanareiks=, Ermenberga = Goth.
  =*Aírminbaírga=. Cp. Wrede, 'Ostg.', 162.

  NOTE 4. =ai= is to be regarded as a difthong (=ái=) in =baitrs=,
  _bitter_; =jains=, _yon, that_ (and its derivations), while
  formerly, according to OHG. bittar, jenêr, it was thought to be
  short (=aí=). Cp. Holtzmann, 'Altd. Gr.', p. 11 et seq.; Brgm.,
  I, 392; Bezzenb. Beitr., 16, 156.--Scherer (Zur Gesch. d. dtsch.
  Sprache) presumed short =aí= also in the 3d pers. sg. prs. opt.
  (like =nimai=) and in several forms of the strong inflection of
  adjs. (nom. pl. m. =blindai=, gen. sg. f. =blindaizôs=, gen. pl.
  =blindaizê=, =blindaizô=). Hirt (Beitr., 18, 284 et seq.) goes stil
  farther in this direction.--Cp. also § 22, n. 3. #/

§ 21. II. +The old Difthong+ =ai=. By far the greater number of the
Gothic =ai=s express a difthongal sound which is equivalent to OHG. ei
or ê (ahd. gr., §§ 43. 44), OS. ê, ON. ei. The Goths of Wulfila's time
indeed seem to hav stil pronounced this =ai= as =a= + =i=.--For the
difthong =ai= we employ Grimm's sign =ái= whenever it is likely to be
confused with =aí=. Exampls of difthongal =ai= (before =h=, =r=, cp.
§ 20, n. 2): The prts. sg. of the I. ablaut-series (§ 30),--=bait=,
_I bit_ (inf. =beitan=); =staig=, _I mounted_ (inf. =steigan=); etc.;
=wait= (§ 197); =ains=, _one_; =hlaifs=, (_loaf of_) _bred_; =staiga=,
_path_; =laisjan=, _to teach_; --=haitan=, _to be calld_; =maitan=,
_to cut_; =skaidan=, _to separate_; =aiws=, _time_; --=hails=, _hale_,
_sound_; =dails=, _deal_.

=ai= appears also in inflectional syllabls of the III. Weak Conjugation
(§ 191): =habais=, =habaida=, etc.; in the prs. opt.: =nimais=, etc.;
=anstais=, gen. sg. of the =i=-decl.; in the str. adjs.: =blindaizôs=,
etc. (§ 123); --final: =gibai=, =anstai=, dat. sg.: =nimai=, 3 prs.
sg. opt.; =blindai=, dat. sg. f. and nom. pl. m. of the str. adj.;
--monosyllabls: =þai=, nom. pl., _these_; =twai=, _2_; =bai=, _both_;
=jai=, _yes_; =sai=, _behold!_; =wai=, _woe!_

  NOTE 1. Latin writers express the Gothic =ai= predominantly by
  ai, ei: =Dagalaiphus=, =Gaina=, =Radagaisus=, =Gisaleicus= (cp.
  Dietrich, 'Ausspr.'), =eils= in a Lt. epigram (Zs. fda., 1, 379).
  On the Bukarest rune-ring (cp. § 221, n. 3) stands =hailag= (Paul's
  'Grundriss', I, 411).--Concerning the difthongal pronunciation of
  the Gothic =ai=, cp. especially Wrede, 'Wand.', 95 et seq.; about
  monofthongization in East Goth., s. Wrede, 'Ostg.', 165.

  NOTE 2. =ai= and =aj= interchange in =wai=, _woe!_; =wai-dêdja=,
  _evil-doer_, and =waja-mêrjan=, _to blasfeme_; in =aiws=, _time_,
  and =ajukdûþs=, _eternity_.

§ 22. Many scholars hold that also the =ai= in the reduplicating ablaut
vs. (§ 182) =saian= and =waian= is difthongal. This =ai=, however,
stands etymologically for Gothic =ê=, and its OHG. equivalent is â (not
ei): OHG. sâen, wâen (cp. ahd. gr., § 359, n. 3.) The difthong =ai=
before a vowel would becum =aj=; hense, =*sajan=, =*wajan=. Here =ai=
perhaps has the sound of long æ, i. e. open e representing close e (ê)
when followd by a vowel; thus, =saian=, =waian=, for =sêan=, =wêan=.

  NOTE 1. Before the =i= of the 3d pers. sg. prs. a =j= is often
  found: =saijiþ= (Mk. IV, 14), =saijiþ= (II. Cor. IX, 6 in A, for
  =saiiþ= in B; Gal. VI, 7. 8. in A, for =saiiþ= in B). Before =a=
  the =j= occurs but onse: =saijands= (Mk. IV, 14). Cp. Beitr. 11, 75
  et seq.

  NOTE 2. Here belongs also the isolated =faian= (Rom. IX, 19, in
  prs. =faianda=); but the prs. to the prt. =laílôun= is =lauan=
  rather than =laian=. Cp. Beitr. 11, 56.

  NOTE 3. Also the =ai= in =armaiô=, _alms_ (Bezzenb. Beitr. 7, 210;
  Beitr. 11, 74), is likely to belong here.--Concerning the fonetic
  values of the =ai=s discust here, cp. especially Beitr. 11, 51
  et seq.; Brgm., I, pp. 126. 127; Wrede, 'Wand.' 99, who, beside
  Holtzmann, is inclined to assume a long sound for these =ai=s;
  Noreen, 'Urg. Lautlehre', p. 35 et seq.

§ 23. That the Goth. =ai= may be both short and long (like a in E.
at, fare) is evident from its regular occurrence in Greek words. As
a rule, =ai= = ε in =aikklêsjô=, ἐκκλησία; =Aileisabaiþ=, Ἐλισάβεθ;
=Baiailzaibul=, Βεελζεβούλ; =Gainnêsaraiþ=, Γεννησαρέτ, etc.; likewise
= αι (i. e. long æ): =Idumaia=, Ἰδουμαία; =Haíbraius=, Ἑβραῖος;
=hairaísis=, αἵρεσις, etc.

  NOTE. Gothic =ai= for Greek η is exceptional; e. g.,
  =Hairodiadins=, gen. to Ἡρωδίας (Mk. VI, 17); =Neikaúdaimus=
  (Skeir. 52); Νικόδημος (for =Nikaúdêmus= elsewhere.)


au

Also Goth. =au= (like =ai=) stands for historically and fonetically
different sounds.

§ 24. I. +The short vowel+ =aú=.--=au= in Gothic denotes a short open
=o=-sound. In this case grammarians put an accute accent over the =u=
(=aú=) in order to keep it apart from the difthong =au=. Goth. =aú=
corresponds to o or u in OHG. and in the other Germanic languages.

The =aú=, before =h= and =r= in Gothic words, has in every instance
developt from a short =u= which, when immediately followd by these
sounds, was 'broken' to short ŏ. E. g.

=waúrms=, _wurm_; =haúrn=, _horn_; =baúrgs= (OHG. burg), _city_;
=waúrd=, _word_; =waúrpum=, prt. pl. of =waírpan=, _to throw_ (cp. §
32); =saúhts= (OHG. suht), _sickness_; =daúhtar=, _daughter_; =aúhsa=,
_ox_; =taúhum=, prt. pl. of =tiuhan=, _to pul_; =baúhta=, prt. of
=bugjan=, _to buy_.

  NOTE 1. =aú= before other sounds is entirely exceptional and
  sumwhat doutful. Thus, in =auftô=, _perhaps_ (onse also =ufto=;
  Mt. XXVII, 64), =bisauljan=, _to sully_; =bisaulnan=, _to becum
  sullied_. Holtzmann (altd. gr., p. 14) regards also =ufbauljan=
  (II. Tim. III, 4) as belonging to this class.

  NOTE 2. The change of short =u= into =aú= before =h= is without
  exception. An apparent exception is the enclitic =-uh=, _and_,
  the =u= of which must be referd to a secondary development; it is
  never found after a short accented vowel, nor after a long vowel or
  difthong; e. g., =sa-h=, =ni-h=, =þai-h=, =wiljáu-h=, =ƕarjanô-h=;
  =u= occurs after consonants, and in polysyllabic words in which a
  final short =a= before the =u= was elided; as, =ƕaz-uh=, =þammuh=
  (= =þamma uh=), =qiþuh= (= =qiþa uh=). Sum, however, assume =-ûh=
  (cp. Beitr. 18, 299).--Other =u=s before =h= ar all long: =þûhta=
  (cp. § 15).--There ar a few cases of =u= before =r= in unaccented
  syllabls (§ 13, n. 1), namely in the foren words =spaikulâtur= and
  =paúrpura= (beside =paúrpaúra=), _purpl_; so, also, in the Gothic
  =fidur-= (§ 141, n. 1) which, however, stands perhaps for =fidûr-=
  (cp. IF. 4, 334).--The prefix =ur-= (in =urreisan=, =urruns=, etc.)
  does not belong here; it is a late form for =us= the =s= of which
  was assimilated to a following =r= (§ 78, n. 4).

  NOTE 3. Not every =au= before =h= and =r= has developt from =u=,
  but may also be the difthong =au=; as, =háuhs=, _high_; =táuh=,
  prt. of =tiuhan= (but pl. =taúhum=, § 31); =gáurs=, _sorry_ (cp.
  OHG. gôrag, _wreched_, and Goth. =gaunôn=, _to mourn_).

  NOTE 4. The =au= for =u= in the endings of the =u=-declension may
  be =aú=, but also =áu= which would be due to confusion caused by
  analogy. Beitr., 18, 280.--Cp. also =uftô= for =auftô=, § 24, n. 1.

  NOTE 5. As a rule, the Greek ο is represented by =aú=; e.
  g., =apaustaulus=, ἀπόστολος; =alabalstraun=, ἀλάβαστρον;
  =Barþaulaumaius=, Βαρθολομαῖος; =Pauntius=, Πόντιος; =aú= = υ in
  =Saúr=, Σύρος; =paúrpaúra=, πορφύρα.--Goth. =aú= = o in the East
  Gothic name =Thorisa=. (Wrede, 'Ostg.', 76. 165).

§ 25. II. +The old difthong+ =au= [= ou in E. house]. Every =au= not
broken from =u= (before =h=, =r=; s. § 24 and note 3) is a difthong; it
corresponds to OHG. au, ou, or ô (ahd. gr., §§ 45. 46), OS. ô, ON. au.
Whenever it is likely to be confused with =aú=, we put (according to
Grimm), an accute accent over the =a= (=áu=). E. g.

The prts. sg. of the II. ablaut-series (§ 31): =gaut=, _I pour_ (inf.
=giutan=); =laug=, _I lied_, etc.; =laugnjan=, _to deny_; =daupjan=,
_to baptize_; =galaubjan=, _to believ_; =galaubeins=, _belief_;
=rauþs=, _red_; =dauþus=, _deth_; --=aukan=, _to increase_; =hlaupan=,
_to run_; =stautan=, _to push, strike_; --=haubiþ=, _hed_; =augô=, _ey_.

=au= in inflections and final occurs in the =u=-declension: =sunaus=,
=sunau=; 1st pers. sg. opt.: =nimau=, =nêmjau=; 3d pers. sg. imper.:
=lausjadau=; opt. midl: =haitaidau=.

  NOTE 1. =au= often interchanges with =aw= (cp. § 42); e. g.,
  =taujan=, prt. =tawida=, _to do_; =mawi=, gen. =maujôs=, _girl_;
  =sniwan=, prt. =snau=, _to hasten_.

  NOTE 2. Latin writers express Goth. =au= by au; as, =Ausila=,
  =Austrovaldus=, =Audericus=. Cp. Wrede, 'Wand.', 96 et seq.
  Concerning East Gothic monofthongizations, s. Wrede, 'Ostg.', 165
  et seq. (Zs. fda., 36, 273²).

  NOTE 3. In the =u=-declension =u= is often found for =áu=; cp. §
  24, n. 4; § 105, n. 2.

§ 26. Another =au=, historically, and probably also fonetically,
different from the preceding ones occurs before vowels.

(a) For original =ô=: =stauida=, prt. of =stôjan=, _to judge_; =staua=,
f., _judgment_; =staua=, m., _judge_; =taui=, n., gen. =tôjis=, _deed_
(cp. also =ubiltôjis=, _evil-doer_; =taujan=, _to do_, prt. =tawida=);
=afmauidai= and =afdauidai=, pps. of =*afmôjan=, and =*afdôjan=, _to
tire out, weary_; =sauil=, n., _sun_.

(b) For û in the other Germanic languages: =trauan= (OHG. trûên), _to
trust_; =bauan= (OHG. bûan), _to dwel_; =bnauan=, _to rub_ (_to pieces_
or _powder_. ON. (g)núa, OHG. nûan). Cp. also § 179, n. 2.

Sinse this =au= does not change into =aw= before vowels, it must denote
a monofthong which is likely to be the long of =aú=, hense a long open
=o= (= a in E. fall), while long close =o= (shading very much to =û=,
like ô in E. home) is denoted by =ô=. Accordingly, Goth. antevocalic
=ô=, =û= past into =au=. Cp. Brgm., I, 156. For the extensiv literature
on this question, s. Noreen's 'Urgerm. Lautlehre', p. 34; also Beitr.,
17, 563-567.

  NOTE 1. Also Gr. ω before a vowel, which is represented as a
  rule by =ô=, is renderd by =au=: =Trauada=, Τρῳάς; =Nauêl=, Νωέ;
  =Lauidja=, Λωίς.

  NOTE 2. =ô= before =u= occurs, however, in the preterit forms
  =waiwôun= (inf. =waian=, § 182), =lailôun= (inf. =*lauan=, § 179,
  4). Cp. Beitr., 11, 74².


APPENDIX.

§ 27. Beside the vowel-signs discust in the foregoing paragrafs, a
few consonant-signs may likewise discharge the function of vowels,
for the Gothic liquids =l=, =r= and the nasals =m=, =n= ar very often
vocalic (i. e. syllabic) at the end of a word after a consonant. Here
an original suffixal vowel was lost in most cases, and in its place the
following liquid or nasal became the bearer of the accent. Thus the
Gothic has dissyllabic words with vocalic liquids or vocalic nasals
(sonant liquids or sonant nasals); as, =ak~r~s=, _field_; =fug~l~s=,
_bird_; =taik~n~s=, _token_; =maiþ~m~s=, _present_.

  NOTE In the West Germanic languages a new vowel (OHG. a) has
  developt from these vocalic liquids and nasals; e. g., OHG. akkar,
  fogal, zeihhan, OS. mêþom. Cp. ahd. gr., § 65, and Brgm., I, 190.
  237.

CHAP. III. TABLE OF THE GOTHIC VOWELS.


A. FONETIC SYSTEM.

§ 28. In the preceding paragrafs the Gothic vowels hav been givn
according to the letters by which they ar represented. Now they wil
be arranged according to the nature of their +sounds+, the following
scale of seven vowels from i to u being taken as a basis:

                          i  e  æ  a  ǫ  o  u.

e and o denote here the close e and o (which shade very much to i and
u, respectivly); æ = open e (= a in fat, fare); ǫ = open o.

In the following survey we shal state after each of these vowel grades
whether it occurs in Gothic, and by what letter it is exprest.

  i:  Short, =i= (§ 10).
      Long, =ei= (§§ 16. 17).
  e:  Short, wanting.
      Long, =ê= (§§ 6-8).
  æ:  Short, =aí= (§ 20).
      Long? (perhaps the ai in § 22).
  a:  Short, =a= (§§ 3. 4).
      Long, =â= (§ 5).
  ǫ:  Short, wanting.
      Long, =ô= (§§ 11. 12).
  u:  Short, =u= (§§ 13. 14).
      Long, =û= (§ 15).

    Difthongs:
  iu: §§ 18. 19.
  ai: § 21.
  au: § 25.


B. HISTORICAL SYSTEM (Ablaut-Series).

§ 29. The Gothic vowels, as regarded from a historico-etymological
point of view, may be groupt into a number of series of related vowels.
The vowels belonging to such a series may interchange in formations
with the same root; in the formation of tenses and in the verbal and
nominal derivation all vowels of the same series may occur, but not
such as hav nothing in common with that series. This change of vowels
within a series is calld +ablaut+ (or gradation), the series themselvs
+ablaut-series+. The ablaut-series ar most perceptibl in the verb. The
relation between the vowels of the same series is not a fonetic but a
+historical+ one; to establish it, we must pass beyond the limits of
the Germanic languages and take recourse to the comparativ grammar of
the Indo-Germanic languages. The Gothic ablaut-series as appearing in
verbal inflection ar these (cp. § 172 et seq.):

§ 30. I. Series: =ei= =ai= =i (aí)=.

Exampls: =reisan= (=urreisan=), =rais=, =risum=, =risans=, _to rize_;
=urraisjan=, _to raiz_; =urrists=, f., _resurrection_; --=þeihan=,
=þaíh=, =þaíhum=, =þaíhans=, _to thrive_; --=wait=, _I know_; pl.
=witum=; =weitan=, _to see_; =weitwôds=, _witness_; =miþ-wissei=,
_conscience_; =witubni=, n., _knowledge_; --=lais=, _I know_;
=lubja-leisei=, f., _wichcraft_; =lists=, f. (?), _stratagem_;
=laisjan=, _to teach_.

  NOTE. The =i= of this series is the proethnic Germanic i mentiond
  in § 10, b.

§ 31. II. Series: =iu= =au= =u (aú)=.

Exampls: =giuta=, =gaut=, =gutum=, =gutans=, _to pour_; =gutnan=,
_to pour_ (intr.); --=liugan=, =laug=, =lugum=, =lugans=, _to lie_;
=liugnja=, m., _liar_; =liugn=, n., _lie_; =analaugns=, _hidn_;
=laugnjan=, _to deny_; --=galaubjan=, _to believ_; =galaubeins=,
_belief_; =liufs=, _dear_; =lubô=, f., _luv_; =lubains=, f., _hope_;
--=siuks=, _sick_; =saúhts=, f., _sickness_; --=driusan=, _to fall_;
=drausjan=, _to drop_ (tr.); =drus=, m., _fall_; =driusô=, f., _slope_.

  NOTE. The vowel =û= is rare in this series; cp. =lûkan=, _to lock_
  (§ 173, n. 2); =anabûsns= (? § 15, n. 1), _command_, < =biudan=.

§ 32. III. Series: =i (aí)= =a= =u (aú)=.

The themes of this series always hav two consonants after the vowel,
mostly a liquid or a nasal in gemination, or a liquid or a nasal +
another consonant. E. g.

=bindan=, =band=, =bundum=, =bundans=, _to bind_; =bandi=, f., _band_;
=bandja=, m., _prisoner_; =gabinda=, f., _band, bond_; =and-bundnan=,
_to becum loose_; =gabundi=, f., _bond_; --=rinnan=, _to run_;
=rannjan=, _to cause to run_; =runs=, m., _a run, course_; =rinnô=,
f., _brook_; --=waírpan=, =warp=, =waúrpum=, =waúrpans=, _to throw_;
=uswaúrpa=, f., _a casting out_ or _away, an outcast_; --=þaírsan=,
_to be dry_; =þaúrsnan=, _to wither_; =þaúrsus=, _dry, witherd_;
=þaúrstei=, _thirst_; --=drigkan=, _to drink_; =dragkjan=, _to giv to
drink_; =dragk=, n., _a drink, potion_; =-drukja=, m., _a drinker_;
=drugkanei=, f., _drunkenness_; --=þriskan=, _to thresh_; =gaþrask=,
n., _threshing-floor_.

  NOTE. The =i= of this and the following two series is that givn in
  § 10, a (= proethnic Germanic e).

§ 33. IV. Series: =i (aí)= =a= =ê= =u (aú)=.

The stems of this series hav a simpl liquid or nasal after the vowel.
E. g.

=niman=, =nam=, =nêmum=, =numans=, _to take_; =-numja=, m., _taker_;
=anda-numts=, f., _a receiving_; =andanêms=, _agreeabl_; =andanêm=,
n., _a receiving_; --=baíran=, =bar=, =bêrum=, =baúrans=, _to bear_;
=baúr=, m., '_natus_'; =barn=, n., _child_; =bêrusjôs=, _parents_;
--=ga-timan=, _to becum, suit_; =ga-tamjan=, _to tame_; =gatêmiba=,
_fitly_.

  NOTE. To this series belongs also =brikan=, =brak=, =brêkum=,
  =brukans=, _to break_: =gabruka=, f., _a broken bit_; =us-bruknan=,
  _to break off_ (intr.); =brakja=, f., _strugl_.--Also =trudan=, _to
  tred_; § 175, n. 2.

§ 34. V. Series: =i (aí)= =a= =ê=.

The vowel of the stems of this series is followd by a singl consonant
other than a liquid or a nasal. E. g.

=giban=, =gaf=, =gêbum=, =gibans=, _to giv_; =giba=, f., _gift_;
=gabei=, f., _richness_; --=sitan=, _to sit_; =satjan=, _to set_;
=anda-sêts=, _abominabl_; --=mitan=, _to mezure_; =mitôn=, _to
consider_; =mitaþs=, f., _mezure_; =usmêt=, n., _manner of life_;
--=ga-nisan=, _to be saved_, _recuver_; =nasjan=, _to save_; =ganists=,
_salvation_.

  NOTE. Also =saíƕan=, =saƕ=, =sêƕum=, =saíƕans=, belongs to this
  class, because =ƕ= represents a singl sound; § 63, n. 1.

§ 35. VI. Series: =a= =ô=.

Most of the stems of this series end in a singl consonant. E. g.

=wakan=, =wôk=, =wôkum=, =wakans=, _to wake_; =waknan=, _to awake_;
=wahtwô=, f., _wach_; =wôkains=, f., _a waching_; --=graban=, _to dig_;
=grôba=, f., _pit, hole_; =graba=, f., _dich_; --=fraþjan=, =frôþ=, _to
understand_; =fraþi=, n., _understanding_; =frôþs=, _wise_; =frôdei=,
f., _understanding, wisdom_; --=hafjan=, =hôf=, _to heav_ (tr.);
=-hafnan=, _to heav_ (intr.); =haban=, _to hav, hold_; =ungahôbains=,
f., _incontinency_; --=ôg=, _I fear_; =unagands=, _fearless_; =ôgjan=,
_to frighten_; =usagjan=, _to terrify_; =agis=, n., _fear_; --=sakan=,
_to contend_; =sakjô=, f., _strife_; =sôkjan=, _to seek_; =sôkns=, f.,
_serch, inquiry_; =unand-sôks=, _irrefutabl_.

§ 36. Series: =ê= =ô= (VII. Ablaut-Series).

A connection between =ê= and =ô= occurs in the so-calld reduplicating
ablaut-verbs =lêtan=, =laílôt=, etc.; =saian= (= =*sêan=, § 22),
=saísô=, etc.; cp. § 180 et seq.

  NOTE. This series is no longer found in the verbal inflection of
  the remaining Germanic languages, but its existence is proved by
  its occurring in word-formation; as, OHG. (â: ô) tât, f., tôn,
  tuon, _to do_; --knâan, _to know_: knôt, chnuat, f., _kin_.--For
  more on this point, s. Beitr. 11, 262 et seq.




CHAP. IV. THE CONSONANTS.


§ 37. The consonant-signs to be discust here both in regard to value
and occurrence in the Gothic language hav alredy been enumerated in
§ 2. We divide the consonantal sounds in +sonorous+ consonants and
+noizd sounds+. Cp. Sievers, Grundzüge der Phonetik⁴, p. 70 et seq.
Accordingly, the Gothic consonant-signs =w=, =j=, =l=, =m=, =n=, =r=,
represent the +sonorous sounds+, the rest the noizd sounds.


A. SONOROUS CONSONANTS.


1. The semivowels w and j.

§ 38. Germanic w and j ar the vowels u and i uzed as consonants; hense
in Gothic the interchange between =i= and =j=, =u= and =w=, according
to their position which determins their fonetic values as vowels or
consonants. The consonantal i and u, which in other languages ar
denoted by the same signs as the vocalic i and u, hav special signs in
Gothic, =j= and =w=. These sounds ar also calld 'semivowels'.


w

§ 39. The sign of the Gothic alfabet which we represent by =w=, is,
according to its form and alfabetic position, the Gr. υ. For this
it also stands in Greek foren words, for exampl, =Pawlus=, Παῦλος;
=Daweid=, Δαυίδ; =aíwaggêljô=, εὐαγγέλιον; =paraskaíwê=, παρασκευή.
But the Gothic =w= stands not only for the Gr. υ of the combinations
αυ, ευ, in which it had perhaps at that time assumed the value
of a spirant, but also for simpl Greek υ, namely vocalic υ; as,
=Swmaíôn=, Συμεών; =swnagôgê=, συναγωγή; =martwr=, μάρτυρ. But in our
transcriptions of the Gothic texts the Greek vocalic υ is exprest by
=y= instead of =w= (=Symaíôn=, =synagôgê=, =martyr=); so, also, for
practical reasons, in this book.

  NOTE 1. A noteworthy Gothic transcription is =kawtsjô= (= Lt.
  cautio) in the document at Naples (§ 221, n. 3). Cp. Wrede,
  'Ostg.', 166; Zs. fda., 36, 273.

  NOTE 2. The Gothic sign is in most of the later editions
  represented by =v=. But because of its correspondence in the
  other Germanic languages the letter =w= should be uzed (as, Goth.
  =wilja=, MHG. NHG. wille, OE. willa, NE. wil). Cp. Beitr., 12, 218
  et seq.

§ 40. In Gothic words the =w= originally had the fonetic value of the
consonantal =u= (= E. w). But at Wulfila's time the =u=-sound seems to
hav alredy containd sumwhat of a spirant. Cp. Zs. fda., 36, 266 et seq.
(37, 121 et seq.).

  NOTE. Latin writers uzually express the =w= in proper nouns by uu.
  =Vvilia=, =Uualamir=; but also often by Ub: =Ubadala= (= =Wadila=),
  =Ubadamirus= (= =Wadamêrs=), etc. Greek authors mostly put οὐ for
  the Goth. =w= (as in Οὐάνδαλοι), but also β (as in Βάνδαλοι). Cp.
  Dietrich, pp. 77-80. Wrede, 'Wand.', 102; 'Ostg.', 167 et seq.

§ 41. Initial Gothic =w= occurs frequently; e. g., =wasjan=, _to
clothe_; =witan=, _to know_; =wiljan=, _to wil_; =waír=, _man_;
=warmjan=, _to warm_.

So also before =l= and =r=; as, =wlits=, _countenance_; =wrikan=, _to
persecute_; =wrôhjan=, _to accuse_.

After the consonants: =t=, =d=, =þ=, =s=; e. g., =twai=, _two_;
=dwals=, _foolish_; =þwahan=, _to wash_; =swistar=, _sister_.

Medial =w= before vowels; e. g., =awistr=, _sheepfold_; =saiwala=,
_soul_; =hneiwan=, _to bow_; =siggwan=, _to sing_; =ûhtwô=, _dawn_;
=taíhswô=, _right hand_; =nidwa=, _rust_.

  NOTE. The signs =q= (=kw=) and =ƕ= (=hw=) ar also uzually explaind
  as combinations of =w= with =k= and =h=. There ar reasons, however,
  to assume that =q= and =ƕ= ar simpl labialized gutturals (§§ 59.
  63). But on the other hand =q= and =ƕ= in High German ar treated
  precisely like Goth. =tw=, =gw=, etc. (= t, g, etc., medial w being
  dropt); for exampl, Goth. =ûhtwô=, =siggwan= = OHG. ûhta, singan;
  and Goth. =sigqan=, =saíƕan= = OHG. sinkan, sehan. Altho this
  proves nothing as to the values of the +Gothic+ signs, it certainly
  shows that in +proethnic Germanic+ the tw, gw, etc., must hav
  denoted sounds analogous to those of kw and hw.

§ 42. (1) =w= remains unchanged after +long+ vowels, +difthongs+,
and +consonants+, (a) finally, (b) before the =s= of the nominativ,
(c) before =j=; e. g., (a) =lêw=, n., _opportunity_; =hlaiw=, n.,
_grave_;, =waúrstw=, n., _work_; (b) =snaiws=, _snow_; =triggws=,
_tru, faithful_; (c) =lêwjan=, _to betray_; =hnaiwjan=, _to abase_;
=skadwjan=, _to cast a shade_ (< =skadus=, _shade_); =arwjô=, adv., _in
vain_.

(2) in all three positions, however, =w= becums =u= after a +short+
vowel; e. g., (a) =snau= (prt. to =sniwan=, § 176, n. 2); =triu=,
_tree_ (gen. =triwis=); =*kniu=, _knee_ (gen. =kniwis=, § 94, n. 1);
(b) =naus=, m., _a ded person_ (gen. =nawis=); =*þius=, _servant_ (gen.
=þiwis=, § 91, n. 3); (c) =mawi=, gen. =maujôs=, _girl_; =gawi=, gen.
=gaujis=, _district_; =þiwi=, gen. =þiujôs=, _maid-servant_; =tawida=,
pres. =taujan=, _to do_; =*straujan=, _to strew_, prt. =strawida;
iujan=, _to quicken_, prt. =qiwida=.--Cp. Grundr., I, 414; Zs. fda.,
36, 277.

  NOTE 1. Hense a word does not end in =aw=, =iw=; =aws=, =iws=,
  except the isolated =lasiws=, _weak_ (II. Cor. X, 10).

  NOTE 2. =aw= for =au= occurs before =j= in =usskawjan=, _to awake_;
  II. Tim. II, 26 (in B); I. Cor. XV, 34 (=ussk..jiþ= in MS.); and in
  the nom. pl. =usskawai= (=unskawai= in MS.), _wakeful_; I. Thess.
  V, 8; cp. § 124, n. 3.

  NOTE 3. No exampl occurs for the position of medial =w= before
  consonants other than =j= and =s=; before =n= after a short vowel
  =u= is found in =qiunan= (< =qiwa-=), _to becum alive_; =siuns=
  (cp. =saíƕa-=).


j

§ 43. The sign =j= stands, as a rule, for the Greek antevocalic ι,
in =Akaja=, Αχαία; =Marja=, Μαρία; =Judas=, Ἰούδας; =Iskarjôtês=,
Ἰσκαριώτης, etc. But Gr. antevocalic ι is also often represented by
Goth. =i=; as, =Iskariôtês=, =Zakarias=, =Gabriêl=, =Iûdas=.--The sign
=j= in Gothic pronunciation probably has the value of a consonantal
=i=, not that of the spirant j in German.

§ 44. (a) +Initial+ =j= in Gothic words: =juk=, _yoke_; =jêr=, _year_;
=ju=, _alredy_; =jus=, _yu_. (b) +Medial+ =j= occurs after vowels and
after consonants, but always +before+ vowels, never before consonants;
e. g., =midjis=, '_medius_'; =lagjan=, _to lay_; =niujis=, _new_;
=frauja=, _lord_; =þrija=, '_tria_'; =bajôþs=, _both_. (c) =ji= is
contracted into =ei= after a consonant belonging to the same syllabl,
but is retaind when the syllabl begins with =j= (cp. Beitr. 16, 282).
The latter is the case when it is preceded by a short high-toned vowel
with a singl consonant or by a long stem-vowel without a consonant.
Exampls--concerning particularly the masculins (and neuters) of
the =ja=-stems (§§ 92. 127)--ar: =har-jis=, =tô-jis= (_doer_), but
=haír-deis=, dat. =haírd-ja=; --also the I. Weak Conjugation (§ 185):
=sô-kja=, =sô-keis=, =sô-keiþ=; =san-dja=, =san-deiþ=; =miki-lja=,
=miki-leiþ=; but =nas-ja=, =nas-jis=, =nas-jiþ=; =stô-ja=, =stô-jis=,
=stô-jiþ=.

  NOTE 1. The rule under (c) may, practically, also be worded in
  the following manner: =ji= becums =ei= after a long stem-syllabl
  and after secondary syllabls, but remains =ji= after a short
  stem-syllabl and immediately after a long stem-vowel.--For
  exceptions, s. § 95; § 108, n. 2; § 132, n. 1.

  NOTE 2. Only =i= is often employd for medial =ij= before vowels;
  s. § 10, n. 4; for =j= occurring sporadically in the inflection of
  =saian=, s. § 22, n. 1.

§ 45. =j= is never +final+; in this position it always becums =i=;
e. g., =harjis=, acc. =hari=; =mawi=, gen. =maujôs= (s. § 42, 2, c);
=taui=, _deed_, gen. =tôjis=.

  NOTE 1. For the change of =aj= and =ai=, s. § 21, n. 2.


2. Liquids.


l

§ 46. Gothic =l= occurs often,--initially, medially, and finally;
as, =laggs=, _long_; =galaubjan=, _to believ_; =liuhaþ=, _light_;
=laúhmuni=, _lightning_; =wiljan=, _to wil_; =aljis=, '_alius_';
=blôma=, _flower_; --dubl =l=, as in =fill=, _hide_; =fulls=, _ful_;
=wulla=, _wool_.

  NOTE 1. =l= is syllabic (§ 27), for exampl, in =fugls=, _bird_
  (_fowl_); =tuggl=, _constellation, star_; =tagl=, _hair_;
  =swumfsl=, _pond_; =sigljan=, _to seal_.

  NOTE 2. Goth. =l= always corresponds to Gr. λ. It is interpolated
  in =alabalstraún=, ἀλάβαστρον.


r

§ 47. =r= is equivalent to Gr. ρ and occurs frequently in Gothic words;
e. g., =raíhts=, _right_; =raubôn=, _to rob_; =baíran=, _to bear_;
=fidwôr=, _four_.--Dubl =r= is rare: =qaírrus=, _meek_; =andstaúrran=,
_to threten_; =faírra=, _far_.

  NOTE 1. Syllabic =r= (§ 27) occurs, for exampl, in =ak~r~s=,
  _field_; =brôþ~r~=, dat. sg. of =brôþar= (§ 114), _brother_;
  =figg~r~s=, _finger_; =tag~r~=, _tear_; =hlût~r~s=, _pure_;
  =fag~r~s=, _suitabl_; =maúrþ~r~=, _murder_; =hugg~r~jan=, _to
  hunger_.

  NOTE 2. Every =i= before =r= becums =aí=, and every =u= in the same
  position =aú=; s. §§ 20. 24.

  NOTE 3. Concerning =r= from =z=, s. § 78, n. 4; § 24, n. 2.


3. Nasals.


m

§ 48. =m= occurs in all positions of a word; as, =mizdô=, f., _reward_;
=mêna=, m., _moon_; =ams=, m., _shoulder_; =guma=, m., _man_; finally:
=nam=, _I took_; in the terminations of the dat. pl.,--=dagam=, etc.;
1st pers. pl.,--=nimam=, =nêmum=, etc.--Dubl (=mm=) in =swamms= (cp.
§ 80, n. 1), _spunge_; =wamm=, n., _spot_; in the pronominal dat.
sg.,--=imma=, =blindamma=.

  NOTE. Syllabic =m= (§ 27) in =maiþ~m~s=, _present_; =bag~m~s=,
  _tree_.


n

§ 49. Initial =n= in =nahts=, _night_; =niujis=, _new_; =ni=
(negation), etc.; medial: =kuni=, n., _kin_; =ains=, _one_, etc.;
final: =laun=, n., _reward_; =niun=, _nine_; often in inflection; as,
dat. sg. =hanin=, inf. =niman=, =nêmun= (3d pers. pl. prt.), etc.

Dubl =n= (=nn=) occurs frequently; e. g., =brinnan=, _to burn_;
=spinnan=, _to spin_; =rinnan=, _to run_; =kann=, _I know_; =kannjan=,
_to make known_; =manna=, _man_; =brunna=, _wel, spring_. Dubl =n=
remains finally and before =j=, but is simplified before other
consonants (s. § 80): =kant=, =kunþa= (inf. =kunnan=), =rant= (2nd
pers. sg. prt.; inf. =rinnan=), =brunsts= (inf. =brinnan=), =ur-runs=
(< =rinnan=), _outlet_.

  NOTE. Syllabic =n= (§ 27) in =usbeis~n~s=, f., _expectation_;
  =taik~n~s=, f., _token_; =ib~n~s=, _even_; =laug~n~jan=, _to deny_;
  =swêg~n~jan=, _to triumf, rejoice_.

§ 50. Before guttural consonants =n= becums a guttural nasal which (in
imitation of the Gr.) is denoted by =g= (=gg=; s. § 67).

  NOTE. The (guttural) nasal disappears before =h=, and the preceding
  short vowel is lengthend. S. § 5, b; § 15, b (Brgm., I, 182 et
  seq.).


B. NOIZD SOUNDS.


1. Labials.


p

§ 51. The letter =p=, which does not occur very often in Gothic,
corresponds to Gr. π.

(a) +Initially+, =p= may be regarded as being altogether wanting in
purely Gothic words; the exampls which do occur ar either obviously
foren words or at least etymologically obscure, if not loanwords too:
=plinsjan=, _to dance_; =plats=, _pach_; =anapraggan=, _to harass_;
=paida=, _coat_; =puggs=, _purse_; =peikabagms=, _date-palm_; =pund=,
_pound_; =plapja=, _street_ ('platea'); =pistikeins=, πιστικός,
=paúrpura=, _purpl_.

(b) =p= occurs in purely Gothic words +medially+ and +finally+; e.
g., =slêpan=, _to sleep_; =greipan=, _to gripe_; =ƕôpan=, _to boast_;
=skapjan=, _to shape, make_; =hlaupan=, _to run_; =diups=, _deep_;
=waírpan=, _to throw_; =hilpan=, _to help_; =skip=, _ship_; =iup=,
_upwards_.--Initial =sp= in =speiwan=, _to spit_; =sparwa=, _sparrow_;
=spillôn=, _to narrate_; =spinnôn=, _to spin_.

  NOTE 1. =pp= does not occur.

  NOTE 2. =p= before =t= becums =f= in =gaskafts=, f., _creature_
  (cp. =skapjan=); =ƕôftuli=, f., _glory_ (cp. =ƕôpan=). Cp. § 81.


f

§ 52. Gothic =f= in foren words corresponds to Gr. φ; e. g.,
=Filippus=, Φίλιππος; =Kajafa=, Καϊάφας. Latin writers render Goth. =f=
mostly by =ph= (Dietrich, p. 75); as, =Dagalaiphus=, =Phaeba=. Hense
Goth. =f= was probably a +bilabial+, not a labiodental spirant, as is
also evident from Goth. =fimf=, =hamfs=.

  NOTE. =f= is regarded as labiodental by Jellinek; Zs. fda., 36, 275
  et seq.

§ 53. (a) +Initial+ =f= occurs often in Gothic words; e. g., =fôtus=,
_foot_; =fadar=, _father_; =flôdus=, _flud_; =faíhu= (_catl_), _muney_;
=fûls=, _foul_; =frôþs=, _wise, judicious_; =frius=, _cold_; =fidwôr=,
_4_.

(b) +Medially+ and +finally+ =f= occurs in but a small number of
Gothic words; as, =hlifan=, _to steal_; =hafjan=, _to heav_; =hiufan=,
_to lament_; =lôfa=, m., _palm of the hand_; =ufar=, _over_; =afar=,
_after_. Before consonants: =luftus=, _air_; =hamfs=, _maimd_;
=tweifls=, _dout_; =wulfs=, _wolf_; --(final) =fimf=, _five_; =hôf=
(prt. of =hafjan=); =þarf=, _I need_ (inf. =þaúrban=).

  NOTE 1. Finally and before the =s= of the nom., =f= occurs very
  often for medial =b=; s. § 56.

  NOTE 2. Medial =f= before =t= (=n=) stands for =b= (§ 56, n. 4),
  before =t= also for =p= (§ 51, n. 2).

  NOTE 3. =ff= is not found.


b

§ 54. =b= corresponds to Gr. β, for which it stands in foren words;
e. g., =barbarus=, βάρβαρος; =Iakôb=, Ἰακώβ. The pronunciation of
the Gr. β was that of a labial soft spirant [nearly = E. v]. In
like manner Goth. =b= has the value of a soft (voiced) labiolabial
spirant +medially+ after vowels, while +initially+ and medially after
consonants it denotes a soft stop (= E. b).

  NOTE 1. Gothic =b= between vowels in Latin foren words stands for
  Lt. v, but after =m= for b: =Silbanus=, _Silvanus_; =Naúbaímbaír=,
  _November_; =(ana)kumbjan=, _cumbere_.

  NOTE 2. In Gothic names Latin writers employ Lt. b for Gothic =b=
  initially and after a consonant (as, =Amala-berga=, =Hildi-bald=,
  =Albila=), but medially between vowels Lt. v is uzed (as, =Liuva=,
  =Erelieva=); cp. Dietrich, p. 71; Beitr., 1, 148 et seq.; Wrede,
  'Ostg.', 169; Zs. fda., 36, 275.

§ 55. Exampls of =b=:

(a) +initially+: =baíran=, _to bear_; =beitan=, _to bite_; =brikan=,
_to break_; =brûkjan=, _to uze_; =blêsan=, _to blow_; =biudan=, _to
offer_; =blôma=, _flower_; =brôþar=, _brother_; =bôka=, _letter_;
=bnauan=, _to rub_.

(b) +medially+: =liuba= (w. m. adj.), _dear_; =galaubjan=, _to believ_;
=graban=, _to dig_; =sibja=, _relationship_; =arbi=, _inheritance_;
=kalbô=, _hefer_; --=haubiþ=, _hed_; =hlaibis= (gen. of =hlaifs=),
_bred_; =sibun=, _seven_; =haban=, _to hav_; =skaban=, _to shave_;
=(bi-)leiban=, _to remain_; =liban=, _to liv_; =biraubôn=, _to rob_;
=salbôn=, _to salv, anoint_.

  NOTE. =bb= occurs in foren words only; as, =sabbatus=.

§ 56. =b= after consonants (=l=, =m=, =r=) remains finally, before
the =s= of the nom., and before the =t= of the 2nd pers. sg. prt.;
postvocalic =b= becums =f=. This means that postvocalic =b= was a soft
spirant (§ 54) which, finally, changed into the corresponding hard
spirant, while postconsonantal =b=, medially and finally, had the
value of a stop. Hense =giban=, _to giv_, 1st and 3d pers. sg. prt.:
=gaf=, 2nd. pers. =gaft=, 2nd sg. imper.: =gif=; =hlaifs=, _bred_,
acc. =hlaif=, nom. pl. =hlaibôs=; --but =lamb=, _lam_; =dumbs=, _dum_;
=swaírban=, _to wipe_, prt. =swarb=.

  NOTE 1. Our texts contain a few exceptions to the rule of final =f=
  for medial =b= after vowels, but the preponderant number of exampls
  prove the validity of the rule which is fonetically founded and
  has a striking analogon in the OS. geƀan--gaf; lioƀo--liof (but
  lamb). The exceptional cases with final =b= (21 in all) occur only
  in definit parts of the texts (7 in Lu., 5 in the epistls to the
  Thess., 4 in Jo., 3 in Skeir., in all the other texts only onse
  each in Mk. and Eph.). Therefore the anomalous =b=s may be referd
  to the writers of the respectiv parts, who either from purely
  orthografic considerations put the medial =b=s also finally, or in
  order to express a later pronunciation as it existed at their time,
  according to which voiced sounds occurd also finally. The latter
  supposition is founded on the fact that in the Arezzo document
  (of the 6th century) the spelling =Gudilub= occurs.--Cp. also the
  remarks on the interchange of =d= and =þ= in § 74, n. 1.

  The exceptions in the verb ar rare, only =grôb= (Lu. VI, 48) and
  =gadôb= (Skeir. 42); --the forms with =f= occur in =gaf=, =gaft=,
  =gif= (very often); onse each: =grôf= (inf. =graban=), =swaif=
  (inf. =sweiban=), =bilaif= (inf. =bileiban=), =skauf= (inf.
  =skiuban=). Accordingly, we may safely write =draif= (prt. of
  =dreiban=, _to drive_).

  Of nouns only =hlaifs= is often found: nom. =hlaifs= (12 times,
  onse =hlaibs=), acc. =hlaif= (19 times, =hlaib= seven times);
  --=twalif=, _twelv_ (12 times, =twalib= 3 times); accordingly, also
  =*ainlif= (dat. =ainlibim=).

  Furthermore the following nominativs must be regarded as normal
  forms: =*stafs=, _element_ (only =stabim= occurs); =*laufs=, _leaf_
  (only =galaubamma= 3 times, =filugalaubis=, =galubaim=), =*gadôfs=,
  _becuming_ (onse =gadôf=, 4 times =gadôb=), =*liufs=, _dear_
  (only forms with more than one syllabl occur: =liubai=, =liuba=,
  =liubana=, etc.). Lastly, also =*þiufs= (= OS. thiof), _thief_, tho
  the nom. accidentally occurs (4 times) as =þiubs=, beside =þiubôs=
  (twice), =þiubê=.

  NOTE 2. Subject to the abuv rule ar also the preps. =of= and =uf=,
  the =f= of which becums medial by enclisis and is changed into
  =b= before the following vowel; =ab-u=, =ub-uh=. In composition,
  however, =f= remains: =af-êtja=, _voracious eater_; =uf-aiþeis=,
  _under oath_. (Cp. =us= in § 78, n. 4).

  NOTE 3. An apparent exception is =þarf=, _I want_ (for =þarb=), pl.
  =þaúrbum=; but =þarf= has real =f= (§ 53) and must be kept apart
  from the pl. with =b= (s. ahd. gr., § 101). =b= stands correctly in
  the adj. =gaþaúrbs=. Cp. § 79, n. 2.

  NOTE 4. =f= before =t= in derivativ words stands for =b= elsewhere
  (§ 81): =gifts=, f., _gift_ (< =giban=, onse =fragibtim=; Lu. I,
  27), =þaúrfts=, _necessity_. =b= is common before =n=: =ibns=,
  =stibna=, =daubnan=, =drôbnan=, but the ending =-ubni= interchanges
  with =-ufni=; as, =fraistubni=, _temptation_, but =waldufni=,
  _power_; =aflifnan=, _to remain, be left_; cp. =laiba=, _remnant_.


2. Gutturals.


k

§ 57. Goth. =k= corresponds to Greek κ, Lt. c; e. g., =Kêfas=, Κηφᾶς;
=aíkklêsjô=, ἐκκλησία; =laíktjô=, _lectio_. Goth. =k= in Greek words
represents also χ; as, =kaúrazein=, Χοραζίν; =ark-aggilus=, ἀρχάγγελος.
The Gr. sign χ is but rarely retaind, always in =χristus= (s. § 2). Cp.
Wrede, 'Ostg.', 54.

  NOTE. The labialized =k= (=kw=) has a special sign (=q= § 59) in
  Gothic.

§ 58. Exampls of =k=: (a) +initially+: =kniu=, _knee_; =kaúrn=, _corn_;
=kuni=, _kin_; =kalds=, _cold_; =kiusan=, _to choose_; =kalbô=, f.,
_calf_; --=sk=: =skeinan=, _to shine_; =skaidan=, _to separate_. (b)
+medially+: =brikan=, _to break_; =aukan=, _to increase_; =akrs=,
_field_; =reiks=, _mighty_; =mikils=, _great_; =waúrkjan=, _to work_;
=laikan=, _to leap_; =rakjan=, _to strech_; +finally+: =ik=, _I_;
=mik=, _me_; =juk=, _yoke_.

  NOTE 1. =kk= occurs in =smakka=, _fig_; =sakkus=, _sack_.

  NOTE 2. In derivativ words =h= takes the place of =k= before =t=
  (§ 81); as, =saúhts=, _sickness_ (cp. =siuks=); =wahtwô=, _wach_
  (cp. =wakan=); =brûhta= (prt. of =brûkjan=); =þâhta= (prt. of
  =þagkjan=).--Sinse there occur no exampls of the 2nd pers. prt.
  of verbs in =k= (as, =wakan=, =aukan=, =têkan=), it is uncertain
  whether the =k= before =t= remaind =k= or was changed into =h=
  (=wôkt= or =wôht=?).


q

§ 59. The Gothic sign =q= does not occur in the Greek alfabet, the
corresponding sign being borrowd from the Latin (Q). In Lt. words it
corresponds to Lt. qu (=qartus=; Rom. XVI, 23) to which it most likely
corresponds also fonetically. The Lt. qu denoted a labialized k-sound
which was a simpl consonant not forming position. Cp. Zs. fdph., 12,
481 et seq.

  NOTE. The dubl sign =kw= (=kv=) which is uzed beside =q= for the
  Gothic character is due to the perception that in the cognate
  languages Gothic =q= is represented by a combination of consonants
  which appears as k with a w-sound closely attacht to it, and is
  therefore exprest by two signs: in OE. by cw, in ON. by kv, in
  OHG. MHG. NHG. by qu. Hense Goth. =qiþan=, _to say_, = OE. cweþan,
  ON. kveþa, OHG. quedan. But from this nothing certain can be
  inferd about the fonetic value of Goth. =q=, altho it is +possibl+
  that its pronunciation was precisely the same as that of NHG. NE.
  qu.--Cp. also § 41, n. 1.

§ 60. Exampls of =q=: =qinô=, _woman_; =*qius=, pl. =qiwai=, _alive_;
=qaírnus=, _mil_; =qiman=, _to cum_; =qrammiþa=, _moisture_; =naqaþs=,
_naked_; =aqizi=, _ax_; =riqis=, _darkness_; =sigqan=, _to sink_, prt.
=sagq=.


h

§ 61. Gothic =h= in Greek words stands for the ruf breathing (as,
=Haíbraius=, Ἑβραῖος; =Hêrôdês=, Ἡρώδης), but the ruf breathing is
often disregarded (as, =ôsanna=, ὡσαννά). Accordingly, Goth. initial
=h= had the value of a mere breathing. Medially and finally it may stil
hav had the value of a fricativ sound (HG. ch). Cp. the assimilations
(§ 62, n. 3) and breaking (§ 62, n. 1). Also initially before
consonants, (=hl=, =hn=, =hr= (=ƕ=)), the =h= had probably retaind a
stronger sound.

  NOTE 1. Latin writers render Gothic =h= by their h (as,
  =Hildibald=, =Hildericus=); but they also omit it; as, =Ariamirus=,
  =eils= = =hails= in the epigram (s. § 21, n. 1), Zs. fda. 1, 379;
  cp. Dietrich, p. 77.

  NOTE 2. Labialized h (hw) has a special sign in Gothic: =ƕ= (§§ 63.
  64).

  NOTE 3. In foren names h is sumtimes interposed medially between
  vowels; as, =Iôhannês=, Ιωάννης; =Abraham=, Ἀβραάμ. Cp. Es. Tegnér,
  Tidskr. for filol. N. R. 7, 304 et seq.

§ 62. Exampls for =h=: (a) +initially+: =haúrn=, _horn_; =hana=,
_cock_; =haírtô=, _hart_; =hails=, _hole, sound_; =hund=, _hundred_;
=hafjan=, _to heav_; --+initial combinations+: =hlaifs=, _bred_;
=hliuma=, m., _hearing_; =hlifan=, _to steal_; =hlûtrs=, _pure_;
=hlahjan=, _to laf_; =hnaiws=, _low_; =hrains=, _clean_; =hrôpjan=, _to
call_; =hrôt=, n., _roof_.--(b) +medially+: =faíhu=, _muney_; =taíhun=,
_ten_; =teihan=, _to show_; =tiuhan=, _to pul_; =saíhs=, _six_;
=nahts=, _night_; =liuhtjan=, _to light_; =filhan=, _to conceal_;
=swaíhra=, '_socer_'.--(c) +finally+: =jah=, _and_; =-uh=, _and_ (cp. §
24, n. 2); =falh= (prt. of =filhan=); =taúh= (prt. of =tiuhan=), etc.

  NOTE 1. Before =h= (as before =r=) =i= is broken to =aí=, =u= to
  =aú=; cp. §§ 20. 24.

  NOTE 2. Dropping of =n= before =h=, which made the preceding vowel
  long: =fâhan= (< =fanhan=), =þûhta= (< =þunhta=), etc.; cp. § 50,
  n. 1; § 5, b; § 15, b.

  NOTE 3. Final =h= in =-uh= (or =-h=; § 24, n. 2), =jah=, =nih=, may
  be assimilated to the initial sound of a following word. But rarely
  in the gospels (cod. argent.) and in codex B, and only before
  particls or prns. beginning with =þ=; frequently, however, also
  before other consonants, in codex A and Skeir; as, =wasuþþan= (=
  =wasuh-þan=, _but it was_); Mk. I, 6; =sumaiþþan= (= =sumaih-þan=,
  _but sum_); Mt. XXVI, 67; =sijaiþþan= (= =sijaih-þan=, _but it
  shall be_); Mt. V, 37; =jaþþê= (= =jah-þê=, _and if_); =niþþan= (=
  =nih-þan=, _and not_); --before +other+ consonants in A: =jalliban=
  (= =jah liban=, _and liv_); II. Cor. I, 8; =jaggatraua= (= =jah
  gatraua=, _and I trust_); Rom. XIV, 14; =jaddu= (= =jah du=, _and
  to_); II. Cor. II, 16; =jabbrusts= (= =jah brusts=); II. Cor. VII,
  15; =nukkant= (= =nuh kant=, _knowest thou now?_); I. Cor. VII, 16;
  exceptionally also in the codex argent., but only in Lu.: =janni=
  (= =jah ni=); Lu. VII, 32; =nissijai= (= =nih sijai=); Lu. XX, 16.

  NOTE 4. Final =h= is sumtimes dropt (in consequence of having lost
  its sharp sound? But cp. Beitr., XV, 277): =ƕarjô= (for =ƕarjôh=);
  Mk. XV, 6; =ƕammê= (for =ƕammêh=); Gal. V, 3; =ƕarjanô= (for
  =ƕarjanôh=); Skeir. 43; oftener =inu= (in A) for =inuh=, _without_;
  the =h= of consonant-combinations is dropt in =hiuma=; Lu. VI, 17.
  VIII, 4 (elsewhere =hiuhma=, _multitude_); =drausnôs=; Skeir. 50
  (beside =drauhsna=, _crum_); =als= (for =alhs=); Mk. XV, 38, etc.
  All these cases ar probably due to the copyists, and most of them
  hav therefore been amended by the editors. Cp. Bernhardt, Vulfila,
  LIII et seq.--Also superfluous =h= occurs: =snauh= (for =snau=); I.
  Thess. II, 16; here, however, it is perhaps the enclitic =-h= (=
  =-uh=, § 24, n. 2).

  NOTE 5. In derivativ words =h= occurs in certain cases beside =k=
  (s. § 58, n. 2) and =g= (§ 66, n. 1).


ƕ

§ 63. The sound of =ƕ= is peculiar to the Gothic, and has no equivalent
in Gr. The Gothic sign (whose alfabetic position is that of the Greek
ψ) is uzually exprest by =hv= (=hw=), because all the corresponding
words of the remaining Germanic languages (at least initially) hav
hw (hu, hv); as, Goth. =ƕeits= = OHG. hwîz, OS. OE. hwît, ON. hvîtr,
_white_. But there ar reasons which justify the assumption that the
Goth. =ƕ= was a simpl consonant. Fonetically, it may be regarded as
a labialized =h= (or a voiceless =w= = NE. wh? Grundr., I, 411). It
is therefore recommendabl to represent the simpl Gothic sign by the
unitary ligature =ƕ=. Cp. Zs. fdph., 12, 481 et seq.; Beitr., 12, 218
et seq.

  NOTE. =ƕ= and =hw= ar not identical in Gothic. This is proved
  by the fact that in composition the final =h= and the following
  initial =w= ar not exprest by =ƕ=, but by =hw=: =þaírhwakandans=,
  _keeping wach (thruout)_; Lu. II, 8; =ubuhwôpida= (=
  =uf-uh-wôpida=; =ufwôpida= < =uf-wôpjan=), _and he cried out_; Lu.
  XVIII, 38.--The simpl sound of =ƕ= is also evident from the fact
  that the verb =saíƕan= is inflected like the verbal stems ending in
  a singl consonant (§ 34, n. 1), and that in reduplication =ƕ= is
  treated like a singl consonant (=ƕaíƕôp=, § 178). Cp. Holtzmann,
  altd. gr. I, 25, together with § 41, n. 1, abuv.

§ 64. Exampls of =ƕ=: +initially+: =ƕas=, _who_; =ƕaírnei=, f., _skul_;
=ƕaírban=, _to walk about_; =ƕeila=, _time_; =ƕôpan=, _to boast_;
=ƕeits=, _white_; =ƕaiteis=, _wheat_; --+medially+: =aƕa=, _water_;
=saíƕan=, _to see_; =leiƕan=, _to lend_; =þeiƕô=, _thunder_; =nêƕa=,
_near_; =aíƕa-tundi=, f., _brambl-bush_; --also +finally+: =saƕ=,
=saƕt= (prt. of =saíƕan=), =nêƕ=, _near_.

  NOTE. =i= and =u= ar broken before =ƕ= as wel as before =h=; cp. §
  62, n. 1.

§ 65. =g= corresponds to Greek γ, also as a guttural nasal; as,
=synagôgê=, συναγωγή; =aggilus=, ἄγγελος.--The pronunciation of the
Gothic initial =g= was quite certainly that of a soft (voiced) stop;
final and medial =g= was possibly a spirant.

  NOTE 1. Latin authors render =g= in Gothic names by g, but
  also by c; as, =Caina= beside =Gaina= (Jornandes), =Commundus=
  (= =Gummundus=); medially, especially before =i=, it is often
  dropt; as, =Eila= beside =Agila=, =Egila=, =Aiulf= (= =Aigulf=),
  =Athanaildus= (= =Athanagildus=); cp. Dietrich, p. 73 et seq.

  NOTE 2. For the pronunciation of medial =g= as a spirant the Latin
  representations may be adduced (cp. especially Wrede, 'Ostg.',
  173 et seq.); but this is contradicted by the fact that final =g=
  does not becum =h= (cp. =b-f=, =d-þ=). Jellinek (Beitr., 15, 276
  et seq.; Zs. fda., 36, 85) infers a 'media affricata' for the
  pronunciation of medial and final =g=; then the value of a stop
  seems more probabl (cp. Wilmanns, D. Gramm., I, 16).

§ 66. =g= occurs frequently in Goth. words, both initially and
medially. E. g. (a) =gasts=, _guest_; =guma=, _man_; =gulþ=, _gold_;
=gôþs=, _good_; =giutan=, _to pour_; =greipan=, _to gripe, seiz_;
=graban=, _to dig_. (b) =agis=, _aw_; =wigs=, _way_; <bgawigan=, _to
move_; =steigan=, _to mount_; =ligan=, _to lie_; =þragjan=, _to run_;
--=augô=, _ey_; =tagr=, _tear_; =tigus=, _ten_; =aigan=, _to hav_;
suffixal =g=: =mahteigs=, _mighty_; =môdags=, _angry_.

Also final =g= remains unchanged: =ôg=, _I fear_; =mag=, _I can_; =wig=
(acc. of =wigs=, _way_), etc.

  NOTE. =g= becums =h= before a suffixal =t= attacht to it (§ 81);
  e. g., =mahts=, =mahta= (prs. =mag=), =ôhta= (prs. =ôg=), =baúhta=
  (inf. =bugjan=), =brâhta= (inf. =briggan=). But there seems
  to be no change of consonants before the =t= of the 2nd pers.
  prt. Only =magt= (1st =mag=) is found (201).--Also elsewhere in
  word-formation an interchange between =h= and =g= takes place in
  words belonging to the same root: =taíhun=, _10_; and =tigus=,
  _decad_; =filhan=, _to conceal_, and =fulgins=, adj., _hidn_;
  =faginôn=, _to rejoice_, and =fahêþs= f., _joy_; =huggrjan=, _to
  hunger_, and =hûhrus=, _hunger_; =juggs=, _yung_; compar. =jûhiza=;
  concerning the interchange between =áig= and =áih=, s. § 203, n. 1.
  Cp. § 79, n. 2.

§ 67. =g= denotes also a guttural nasal (s. § 50); e. g., (=n= + =g=):
=laggs=, _long_; =briggan=, _to bring_; =tuggô=, _tung_; =figgrs=,
_finger_; =gaggan=, _to go_; --(=n= + =k=, =q=): =drigkan=, _to drink_;
=þagkjan=, _to think_; =þugkjan=, _to seem_; =igqis=, _(to) yu both_;
=sigqan=, _to sink_; =stigqan=, _to thrust_.

  NOTE 1. Beside the singl letter =g= uzed to express the guttural
  nasal, =gg= is sumtimes found (so regularly in codex B): =siggqan=,
  =driggkan=, =iggqis=; =g= is not dubld before =g=; the only
  case, =atgagggand= (Mt. IX, 15) is corrected by the editors. The
  reverse error occurs three times: =faúragagja= (for =faúragaggja=,
  _steward_); Lu. VIII, 3. XVI, 1; =hugridai= (for =huggridai=); I.
  Cor. IV, 11. Cp. Vulfila by Bernhardt, p. LI.

  NOTE 2. The Latin sign (n) for the guttural nasal occurs but a few
  times in Lu.; as, =þank=; XVII, 9; =bringiþ=; XV, 22.

§ 68. The combination =ggw= deservs special notice. (1) It is a
guttural nasal + =gw=, as is proved by the ng of the remaining Germanic
languages (also of the ON.): =aggwus=, _narrow_ (OHG. engi, ON. ǫngr);
=siggwan=, _to sing_ (OHG. singan, ON. syngva); =saggws=, _song_. Here
perhaps belongs also =unmanariggws=, _unrestraind, wild_ (cognate with
OHG. ringi? Dtsch. Litteraturzeitg. 1888, p. 770).

(2) Another =ggw= corresponds to West-Germanic uw (OHG. uu or uuu; cp.
ahd. gr., §§ 112. 113), to ON. gg(v); this =gg= certainly denotes a
stop: =triggws=, _faithful_ (OHG. triuwi, ON. tryggr); =bliggwan=, _to
beat_ (OHG. bliuwan); =*glaggwus=, _exact_ (OHG. glauwêr, ON. glǫggr);
=skuggwa=, _mirror_ (ON. skyggja; cp. Goth. =skawjan=).

  NOTE. Concerning the =ggw= of the words givn under (2) and the
  analogous =ddj= (§ 73, n. 1), cp. Beitr., IX, 545; Göttinger
  Nachrichten, 1885, No. 6; Brgm., I, 157; Scherer, 'Kleinere
  Schriften', I, p. XII et seq.--Concerning the East-Gothic names
  =Triggua=, =Trigguilla=, s. Wrede, 'Ostg.', 78 et seq.


3. Dentals.


t

§ 69. Gothic =t= corresponds to Greek τ, and stands frequently both
initially and medially. E. g. (a) +initially+: =tunþus=, _tooth_;
=triu=, _tree_; =tuggô=, _tung_; =tagr=, _tear_; =taíhun=, _ten_;
=twai=, _two_; =tamjan=, _to tame_; =trauan=, _to trust_. =st=:
=steigan=, _to mount_. (b) +medially+: =watô=, _water_; =haírtô=,
_hart_; =baitrs=, _bitter_; =itan=, _to eat_; =giutan=, _to pour_;
=sitan=, _to sit_; =witan=, _to know_.

Final =t= remains unchanged; as, =wait=, _I know_; =at=, _at_; =wit=,
_we two_.

  NOTE 1. =t= is dubld in =atta=, _father_; =skatts=, _muney_.

  NOTE 2. =t= before =t= in derivativ and inflected words becums =s=
  (§ 81); as, =ushaista=, _very poor_ (cp. =haitan=); =blôstreis=,
  _wurshipper_ (cp. =blôtan=, _to wurship_); 2nd pers. sg. prt.
  =waist= (1st =wait=), =haíhaist= (inf. =haitan=, _to be calld_);
  weak prt. =gamôsta= (1st pers. =gamôt=); =kaupasta= (inf.
  =kaupatjan=, _to cuf_); =wissa= (< =wista=, 1st =wait=).

§ 70. Gothic =þ= corresponds to Gr. θ (as, =Þômas=, Θωμᾶς; =Naþan=,
Ναθάν); its sound-value was that of a voiceless dental spirant = the
NE. surd th in thin. Also the Greek θ denoted at that time, as it stil
does in New Greek, a similar sound.

  NOTE 1. Greek authors represent the Goth. =þ= by θ; as, Θευδέριχος.
  Latin writers express Goth. =þ= mostly by th; as, =Theodoricus=,
  =Theodomirus=, but also often by t. Cp. Wrede, 'Wand.', 104;
  'Ostg.', 170 et seq.--In like manner sum later prints hav =th= for
  =þ= (s. § 1, n. 3).

  NOTE 2. Latin authors often uze d beside th for medial =þ= in
  proper nouns, from which a later softening may be inferd. Cp.
  Wrede, 'Ostg.', 171.

  NOTE 3. Concerning the sound-value of Germanic-Goth. =þ=, cp. IF.
  4, 341 et seq.; for the relation between Goth. =þ= and Gr. θ, s.
  Wimmer, 'Die Runenschrift', 268.

§ 71. =þ= in Gothic words is very frequent. E. g. (a) +initially+:
=þulan=, _to suffer_; =þanjan=, _to strech_; =ga-þaírsan=, _to wither_;
=þaúrsus=, _witherd_; =þaúrstei=, _thirst_; =þata= (prn.), _that_;
=þu=, _thou_; =þreis=, _three_; =þliuhan=, _flee_; =ga-þláihan=, _to
cumfort, console_; =þwahan=, _to wash_. (b) +medially+: =brôþar=,
_brother_; =tunþus=, _tooth_; =wiþrus=, _lam_; =fraþi=, n.,
_understanding_; =fraþjan=, _to understand_; =anþar=, _other_; =ƕaþar=,
'_uter_'; =waírþan=, _to becum_; =qiþan=, _to say_. (c) Also +final+
=þ= remains unchanged; as, =þiuþ=, n., _good_ (gen. =þiuþis=); =qaþ=,
prt. of =qiþan=; =aiþs=, acc. =aiþ=, _oath_.

  NOTE 1. =þþ= occurs in =aiþþau=, _or_ (§ 20), and, by assimilation,
  for =h-þ=: =niþþan=, etc.; s. § 62, n. 3.

  NOTE 2. =þ= finally and before the =s= of the nom. very often
  stands for =d=, and must be kept apart from the =þ= mentiond under
  (c) which remain =þ= +medially+ also; s. § 74.

  NOTE 3. =þ= becums =s= before =t= (§ 81); e. g., 2nd pers. sg. prt.
  =qast= (inf. =qiþan=), =warst= (inf. =waírþan=), =snaist= (inf.
  =sneiþan=, _to cut_).

  NOTE 4. =d= stands for medial =þ= in =weitwôdida=, _testimony_; Jo.
  III, 32.


d

§ 72. Goth. =d= corresponds to Greek δ. The New Greek pronunciation
of δ is that of a soft (voiced) dental spirant (ð = NE. th in thou).
Gothic =d=, at least medially after a vowel, likewise had the
sound-value of this spirant. But d initially and medially after n, r,
l, z, has the value of a soft (voiced) stop.

§ 73. Examples of =d=: (a) +initially+: =daúr=, n., _door, gate_;
=daúhtar=, _daughter_; =dal=, _dale, valley_; =dauns=, _odor_;
=daddjan=, _to suckl_; =ga-daúrsan=, _to dare_; =driusan=, _to fall_;
=dwals=, _foolish_. (b) +medially+: =sidus=, _custom_; =wadi=, n.,
_wager_; =midjis=, '_medius_'; =widuwô=, _widow_; =biudan=, _to offer_;
=bindan=, _to bind_; =haírda=, _herd_; =waldan=, _to rule_; =mizdô=,
_reward_; =fadar=, _father_; =frôdei=, _understanding_ (cp. =frôþs=,
=frôdis=, _intelligent_); =fidwôr=, _four_; =þridja=, '_tertius_';
=þiuda=, _peple_; =-ida=, as in =auþida=, _desert_; =gahugds=, _mind_;
=gards=, _house_ (_yard_); =hardus=, _hard_; =hund=, _hundred_; =and=,
_on, in_; =alds=, _age_ (cp. =alþeis=, _old_), =kalds=, _cold_;
=gazds=, _sting_.

  NOTE. In Gothic words =dd= is found only in =waddjus=, _wall_ (ON.
  veggr); =daddjan=, _to suckl_; =twaddjê= (gen. of =twai=, _2_;
  ON. tweggja); =iddja=, _I went_; hense always in the combination
  =ddj=.--Cp. § 68, n. 1; and Brgm., I, 127.

§ 74. Finally and before the =s= of the nominativ =d= remains only
after a consonant; e. g., =hund=, =nimand= (3d pers. pl. prs.),
=gards=, =alds=, =gazds=, =gahugds=. But postvocalic =d= becuming final
(and before the =s= of the nominativ) is changed into =þ=, because =þ=
denotes the hard sound corresponding to =d=. Such eufonic =þ=s from
medial =d=s constitute the greater number of the Gothic final =þ=s, the
smaller number ar original (also medial) =þ=s. (§ 71, n. 2). E. g.

=staþs=, =stadis=, _place_ (but =*staþs=, =staþis=, _shore_); =haubiþ=,
=haubidis=, _hed_; =liuhaþ=, =liuhadis=, _light_; =frôþs=, =frôdis=,
_wise_; =gôþs=, =gôdis=, _good_; =báuþ=, prt. of =biudan=; =bidjan=,
_to pray_, prt. =baþ=; --all pps. of wvs.; as, =nasiþs=, =nasidis=;
=salbôþs=, =salbôdis=; furthermore all final =þ=s in verbal inflection
(3d pers. sg., 2nd pl.); as, =nimiþ=, =nêmuþ=, =nêmeiþ=,--but with
enclitic =-uh=: =nimiduh=, =nêmuduh=, =nêmeiduh=; --advs. like =ƕaþ=,
_whither_ (cp. § 213); prep. =miþ=, _with_.

  NOTE 1. The change of final =d= into =þ= does not occur in all
  cases in our manuscripts. This exception does not concern the
  original text of Wulfila, but is only a deviation from the normal
  state of orthografy, which is proved by the fact that final =d=
  occurs exceedingly often only in Lu., especially in the first ten
  chapters, not quite rarely also in Jo., more rarely in the other
  books. Exampls from the sixth chapter of Lu. ar: =samalaud= (34),
  =gôds= (35. 43), =gôd= (43), =mitads= (38), ptc. =gamanwids=
  (40), =gasulid=, and especially frequently verbal forms: =taujid=
  (2), =ussuggwud= (3), =faginôd=, =laikid= (23), =habaid= (24),
  =usbaírid= (45), etc.--Sinse yunger forms of speech ar a
  characteristic feature of the gospel of Lu. (§ 221, 1), they might
  be regarded as representativs of a later development of the Goth.
  language, introduced into our text by sum writers (for similar
  cases in East-Gothic names, s. Wrede, 'Ostg.', 171). Others explain
  the forms with final =d= as being due to their original position
  before words beginning with a vowel according to which the forms
  =nimiþ= and =nimid= would be 'dublets' ('satzdubletten').--Cp. also
  Kock, Zs. fda., 26, 226 et seq., who shows that these =d=s for
  =þ=s ar most frequent after unaccented vowels (as in =mitads=), but
  after an accented vowel only when the latter is long or a difthong,
  rarely after a short accented vowel (as in =mid=; Lu. VII, 11.)

  NOTE 2. Sinse the final =þ= has by all means to be regarded as the
  regular one, it must also be employd in words of which only forms
  with medial =d= occur: =biuþs=, =biudis=, _table_; =rauþs=, _red_;
  =usdauþs=, _zelous_; =gamaiþs=, _maimd_; =môþs=, _anger_; =knôþs=,
  _stock, race_. Hense also =garaiþs=, _redy_; =unlêds=, _poor_,
  which, beside the forms with medial =b=, hav onse each the final
  forms =garaid= and =unlêds=, respectivly. But both forms occur in
  Lu.

  With final =d= +only+ ar repeatedly found: =weitwôds=, _witness_,
  acc. =weitwôd=; twice =gariuds= (=gariud=), _honorabl_; only
  +one+ final form with =d= (but none with =þ=) occurs in =braids=,
  _broad_; =dêds=, _deed_; =wôds=, _mad, possest_; =grids=, _step,
  grade_; =skaískaid= (prt. of =skaidan=). The normal forms would
  be =dêþs=, =wôþs=, etc., for the forms with =d= insted of =þ= ar
  hardly due to anything else but unfavorabl transmission.

  NOTE 3. The occurrence of this final =þ= for thematic =d= must
  not be confounded with that of =þ= in words that hav also medial
  =þ= beside =d= in other words from the same root; as, =frôd-=
  (nom. =frôþs=), _prudent_; =frôdei=, _prudence_; but =fraþi=,
  _understanding_, =fraþjan=, _to understand_; =sad-= (nom. =saþs=),
  _satisfied_, but =ga-sôþjan=, _to satisfy_; =sinþs=, _a going,
  way_, but =sandjan=, _to send_; =alds=, _age_, but =alþeis=, _old_.
  Cp. § 79, n. 2.

  NOTE 4. =þ= is seldom found where medial =d= is expected; as,
  =guþa= (for =guda=); Gal. IV, 8; =unfrôþans=; Gal. III, 3.

§ 75. The =d= of the weak preterit, which stands mostly after vowels
(=nasida=, =habaida=), remains intact after =l= and =n= (=skulda=,
=munda=), while after =s=, =h=, =f= it becums =t=: =kaupasta=, =môsta=,
=daúrsta=, =þâhta=, =brâhta=, =þûhta=, =brûhta=, =waúrhta=, =baúhta=,
=ôhta=, =mahta=, =áihta=, =þaúrfta=; it is changed into =þ= in =kunþa=;
=ss= is assimilated from =st= in =wissa=.

Conform to this rule ar the respectiv ptcs. =nasiþs=, =habaiþs=,
=skulds=, =munds=, but =waúrhts=, =baúhts=, =mahts=, =binaúhts=,
=þaúrfts=, =kunþs=. Cp. § 187, n. 1; § 197 et seq.; §§ 208. 209.

  NOTE. =d= becums =s= before the =t= of the 2nd pers. prt. (§ 81):
  =baust= (1st =bauþ=, inf. =biudan=); so, also, before consonants
  in derivativ words; as, =gilstr=, _tax, tribute_ (< =gildan=);
  =usbeisns=, _expectation_ (< =usbeidan=, _to abide, expect_).


s

§ 76. =s= is a hard (voiceless) dental spirant and corresponds to Gr.
σ. =s= occurs very often in Gothic words, especially initially. E. g.

(a) +initially+: =sunus=, _sun_; =sitan=, _to sit_; =skadus=, _shade_;
=speiwan=, _to spit_; =standan=, _to stand_; =straujan=, _to strew_;
=slêpan=, _to sleep_; =smals=, _small_; =snutrs=, _wise_; =swaíhra=,
_father-in-law_.

(b) +medially+: =kiusan=, _to choose_; =wisan=, _to be_; =wasjan=, _to
clothe_; =þûsundi=, _thousand_; =gasts=, _guest_; =fisks=, _fish_;
=asneis=, _hired man_; =hansa=, _host_; =aúhsa=, _ox_; =þaúrsus=,
_witherd_.

(c) Also +final+ =s= remains unchanged; as, =gras=, _grass_; =mês=,
_table_; =was= (prt. of =wisan=), _was_; =hals=, _neck_.

  NOTE 1. =ss= occurs frequently; e. g., =ƕassei=, _sharpness_;
  =qiss=, _speech_; =wissa= (prt. of =witan=); suff. =-assus=
  (=þiudinassus=, _kingdom_, etc.).

  NOTE 2. Final =s= stands in most cases for medial =z=, especially
  the final inflectional =s=. Cp. § 78; dropping of the =s= of the
  nominativ in § 78, n. 2.

  NOTE 3. For =s= from =t=, =þ=, =d=, before consonants (=t=), s. §
  69, n. 2; § 71, n. 3; § 75, n. 1.

  NOTE 4. Concerning the fonetic distinction between the spirants =s=
  and =þ=, cp. IF., 342.

§ 77. The sign =z= corresponds in Greek words to ζ; as, =Zaíbaídaius=,
Ζεβεδαῖος; =azymus=, ἄζυμος. Its sound, like that of the Gr. ζ both at
Wulfila's time and in New Greek, was the corresponding soft sound of
=s=, hense a voiced dental spirant (E. z).

§ 78. (a) In Goth. words =z= occurs never +initially+.

(b) +Medial+ =z= is frequent. But final =z= becums =s=, the
corresponding hard sound (cp. § 79). E. g.

=azêts=, _easy_; =hazjan=, _to praise_; =hazeins=, _praise_; =dius=,
gen. =diuzis=, _animal_; =hatis=, gen. =hatizis=, _hatred_; =hatizôn=,
_to be angry_; =huzd=, _trezure_; =gazds=, _sting_; =mizdô=,
_reward_; =azgô=, _ashes_; =marzjan=, _to offend_; =talzjan=, _to
teach_; --comparativs: =maiza=, '_major_'; =frôdôza=, =alþiza=, etc.;
--pronominal forms; as, =izwara=, =þizôs=, =þizê=, =blindaizôs=; 2nd
pers. sing. midl: =haitaza=.

(c) Most of the Gothic final =s=s represent =z=, especially the
inflectional =s=; this reappears as =z= when it becums medial by an
enclitic addition, for exampl, the =s= of the nom. =ƕas=, _who?_,
but =ƕazuh=; =is=, _he_, but =izei=, _who_; =us=, _out_, but =uzuh=,
=uzu=; =dis-= (as in =dizuhþansat=; Mk. XVI, 8); =þôs=, nom. pl. f.,
but =þôzuh=; =weis=, _we_; =weizuh=; =wileis=, 2nd pers. sg., but
=wileizu=; advs.: =mais= (compar. =maiza=), _more_; =áiris=, _erlier_
(compar. =áiriza=), etc.

  NOTE 1. =z= is but rarely employd for final =s=: =minz=, _less_;
  II. Cor. XII, 15 (Codex B), for =mins= elsewhere; =riqiz= (4
  times), _darkness_, beside =riqis=, gen. =riqizis=; =aiz=, _brass,
  muney_ (only Mk. VI, 8); =mimz=, _flesh_; I. Cor. VIII, 13.--For a
  different view of final =s= for =z=, s. Wilmanns, Dtsch. Gramm., I,
  p. 86.

  NOTE 2. The =s= (=z=) of the nom. sg. is dropt (1) after =s= (=ss=,
  =z=): =drus=, m., gen. =drusis=, _fall_; =swês=, gen. =swêsis=,
  adj., _one's own_; =laus=, =lausis=, _loose_; =us-stass=, f.,
  gen. =usstassais=, _resurrection_; (2) after =r= immediately
  preceded by a short vowel: =waír=, =waíris=, _man_; =baúr=, _sun_;
  =kaisar=, _Cæsar_; =anþar=, _other_; =unsar=, _our_; but =s=
  remains unchanged after a long syllabl: =akrs=, _field_; =hôrs=,
  _whoremonger_; =skeirs=, _clear_; =swêrs=, _honord_; =gáurs=,
  _sorrowful_. An exception is the onse occurring nom. =stiur=,
  _steer, calf_. Cp. Brgm., I, 516; II, 531; Wrede, 'Ostg.', 177 et
  seq.--At a later stage of development, especially in East-Gothic,
  the loss of the nominativ=-s= occurs more extensivly. So alredy in
  the Documents (Neap. Doc.: =Gudilub=, =Ufitahari=); cp. Wrede, loc.
  cit.

  NOTE 3. =z= and =s= interchange in the prt. of =slêpan=; =saíslêp=;
  Mt. VIII, 24. Lu. VIII, 23. I. Thess. IV, 14; =saízlêp=; Jo. XI,
  11. I. Cor. XV, 6; --in the neuters in =-is= (gen. =agisis= and
  gen. =hatizis=); s. 94, n. 5.

  NOTE 4. The =z= (s. c, abuv) of the prep. =us= is in compounds
  assimilated to a following =r= (cp. § 24, n. 2); e. g., =urruns=,
  _a running out_; =urreisan=, _to (a)rise_; =urrûmnan= (beside
  =usrûmnan=, in Codex B, II. Cor. VI, 11), _to expand_; onse =ur=
  for the prep. =us=: =ur riqiza=; II. Cor. IV, 6.--=us= remains
  unchanged before other sounds in cpds.; as, =usagjan=, _to
  frighten_; =usbeidan=, _to abide, expect_ (cp. § 56, n. 2). =z=
  for =s= before a vowel appears only in =uzôn= (prt. of =*usanan=,
  _to expire_); Mk. XV, 37. 39; and in =uzêtin= (dat. of =*usêta=,
  _manger_); Lu. II, 7. 12. 16.

  NOTE 5. When =us= is affixt to a word beginning with =st=, only
  one =s= is sumtimes writn: =ustaig= (prt. of =us-steigan=); Mk.
  III, 13; =ustôþ=; Lu. VIII, 55. X, 25; =ustandiþ= (prt. and prs.
  of =us-standan=); Mk. X, 34; =ustassai= (nom. =usstass=); Lu. XIV,
  14.--Cp. =twistandans= (in B = =twis-standans= in A); II. Cor. II,
  13; =diskritnan= (for =dis-skritnan=); Mt. XXVII, 51; there is no
  analogon for =sp=.


APPENDIX.

GENERAL REMARKS ON THE CONSONANTS.

§ 79. The Gothic soft spirants, =b=, =d=, =z=, finally and before the
=s= of the nom. (cp. §§ 56. 74. 78) ar changed into the corresponding
hard sounds, =f=, =þ=, =s=, while the fourth soft spirant, medial =g=,
remains unchanged when final (§ 66; § 65, n. 2).

  NOTE 1. Also the final =b=, =d=, =z= hav sumtimes remaind
  unchanged, i. e. =z= rarely (§ 78, n. 1), but =b= and =d=
  especially often in certain parts where also other forms show a
  later stage of development. Cp. § 56, n. 1; § 74, n. 1, and Zs.
  fda., 25, 226 et seq.

  NOTE 2. Interchange between =f= and =b=, =þ= and =d=, =h= and =g=,
  =s= and =z=, which had taken place in proethnic Germanic according
  to definit laws and is better preservd in other Germanic languages
  ('Grammatical Change'; s. ahd. gr., § 100 et seq.), occurs in
  Gothic only in derivativ words; cp. =g-h=, § 66, n. 1; =d-þ=, §
  74, n. 3; (=z--s=, § 78, n. 3); and traces of it ar seen in the
  inflection of the verbs =þarf= (§ 56, n. 3), =áih= (§ 203, n. 1).

§ 80. Gemination of the Gothic liquids and nasals, =l=, =m=, =n=, =r=,
is frequent; also =ss= and a few instances of =kk= (§ 58, n. 1), =tt=
(§ 69, n. 1), =þþ= (§ 71, n. 1), =dd= (§ 73, n. 1); --the more frequent
exampls of =gg= (§§ 67. 68) ar in part of another kind.

The geminated consonants remain unchanged when final and before the =s=
of the nominativ: =skatts=, =full=, =kann=, =rann=, =wamm=, =gawiss=;
likewise before =j= (as in =fulljan=, =skattja=, =kannjan=, etc.),
but ar as a rule simplified before other consonants: =kant=, =kunþa=
(cp. =kann=); =rant=, 2nd pers. sg. prt., =ur-runs=, m., _a running
out_ (cp. =rinnan=); =swumfsl=, _pond_ (cp. =*swimman=); --but uzually
=fullnan=, only a few times =fulnan=.

  NOTE. Sum instances of gemination as wel as of simplified
  gemination in the MSS. ar merely orthografic errors; as, =allh= for
  =alh=; Lu. II, 46; =wisêdun= (=s= for =ss=); =inbranjada= (=nj= for
  =nnj=); Jo. XV, 6; =swam= for =swamm=; Mk. XV, 36.--Such errors ar
  mostly corrected by the editors. Cp. Bernhardt, 'Vulfila', p. LVII.

§ 81. The changes of consonants before dentals may, as far as the
Gothic is concernd, be embraced in the following rule:

Before the dentals, =d=, =þ=, =t=, all labial stops and spirants ar
changed into =f=, all gutturals into =h=, all dentals into =s=, the
second dental appearing always as =t=. E. g.

=skapjan=, =gaskafts= (§ 51, n. 2); =þaúrban= (=*þaúrbda=), =þaúrfta=;
=giban=, =gifts= (§ 56, n. 4); --=siuks=, =saúhts=; =þagkjan=, =þâhta=
(§ 58, n. 2); =magan=, =mahta= (§ 66, n. 1); --=wait=, =waist= (§ 69,
n. 2); =waírþan=, =warst= (§ 71, n. 3); =biudan=, =baust= (§ 75, n. 1).

  NOTE 1. Exceptions ar =magt= (2nd pers. sg.; 1st =mag=, § 201) and
  =gahugds=, _mind_.

  NOTE 2. =st= often becums =ss= by assimilation; as, =wissa=, prt.
  of =witan= (§ 76, n. 1). Cp. Beitr., 7, 171 et seq.; 9, 150 et
  seq.; IF., 4, 341 et seq.

  NOTE 3. The rule givn abuv from a practical standpoint of
  the Gothic grammar must be formulated differently from
  a comparativ-historical standpoint, because the discust
  sound-shiftings hav not originated in the Gothic language, but ar
  reflections of proethnic Germanic and Indo-Germanic relations of
  sounds. S. Brgm., I, 381 et seq.; 403 et seq.

§ 82. Assimilations occur only in combination with =h= (s. § 62, n. 3)
and =us= (§ 78, n. 4).




INFLECTION.




CHAP. I. DECLENSION OF SUBSTANTIVS.


GENERAL PRELIMINARY REMARKS.


(a) On declension in general.

§ 83. The Gothic declension, like that of the remaining Old-Germanic
dialects, comprises three genders: the +masculin+, +neuter+ and
+feminin+.

  NOTE 1. The neuter of all declensions resembls in form very closely
  the masculin; a distinction occurs in the nom. and acc. sg. and pl.
  only.

  NOTE 2. A distinction of gender is wanting only with the personal
  prn. of the 1st and 2nd persons, with the reflexiv prn. (§ 150),
  and with the numeral adjectivs 4-19 (§ 141).

§ 84. The Goth. declension has +two+ numbers: +singular+ and +plural+.

  NOTE. The +dual+ which originally existed in all Indg. languages,
  is preservd in the Goth. decl. in the 1st and 2nd pers. of the
  personal prn. only (§ 150).

§ 85. The Goth. declension has four complete cases: +nominativ+,
+genitiv+, +dativ+, +accusativ+. The +vocativ+ is mostly identical
with the nominativ, only in the singular of sum classes of declension
the vocativ is different from the nominativ, but then it is always
identical with the accusativ.

  NOTE. The Goth. dativ represents several Indg. cases (dativ,
  locativ, ablativ, instrumental). Relics of the neuter instrumental
  ar stil present in the pronominal declension: =þê= (§ 153), =ƕê= (§
  159).


(b) On the declension of substantivs.

§ 86. The declension of substantivs in Gothic is divided into a vocalic
and a consonantal declension, according as the stems of the substantivs
end in a vowel or a consonant.

  NOTE. The original form of the stem is in part unrecognizabl in the
  Gothic language, because the stem has blended with the endings,
  final vowels hav been lost, and the like, so that the division
  into a vocalic and a consonantal declension appears correct only
  in the light of the Comparativ Indo-Germanic Grammar, and but with
  reference to this it must be retaind. Such a division would never
  hav been made from an especially Gothic-Germanic standpoint.

§ 87. Of the +consonantal+ stems in Gothic the =n=-stems (i. e. the
stems in =-an=, =-ôn=, =-ein=), ar very numerous, while of other
consonantal declensions but a few remains ar preservd (§ 114 et seq.).
Sinse the time of Jac. Grimm the =n=-declension has also been calld
+Weak Declension+.

§ 88. There ar four classes of the +vocalic+ declension: stems in =a=,
=ô=, =i=, =u=. Accordingly, we distinguish them as =a-=, =ô-=, =i-=,
and =u=-declensions. The stem-characteristics ar stil clearly seen in
all classes in the dat. and acc. pl.; e. g., =dagam=, =dagans=; --
=gibôm=, =gibôs=; -- =gastim=, =gastins=; -- =sunum=, =sununs=. Sinse
the time of Jacob Grimm the vocalic declension has also been calld
+Strong Declension+.

  NOTE 1. Of the four vocalic declensions the =a-= and
  =ô-=declensions ar closely connected, the =a=-declension containing
  only masculins and neuters (=dags=, =waúrd=), the =ô=-declension
  the corresponding feminins. Both classes ar therefore uzually givn
  as one, the =a=-declension.

  NOTE 2. The Gothic =a=-declension corresponds to the second or
  o-declension in Greek and Latin (Gr. m. -ος, n. -ον; Lt. -us, -um),
  the Goth. =ô=-declension corresponds to the first or ā-declension
  in Gr. and Lt. Now sinse Comparativ Grammar teaches us that the
  Græco-Lt. vowels ar the more original ones, and that onse also the
  Germanic stems of the corresponding masculine and neuters must
  hav ended in o and those of the feminins in â, we often meet in
  Germanic Grammar with the term o-declension for the masculins and
  neuters, and with the term â-declension for the feminins.


(c) On the nominal composition.

§ 88ᵃ. Substantivs (and adjectivs) as the first parts of compounds
end as a rule in a vowel, the connecting vowel of the components
(or composition-vowel), which in the case of the vocalic stems
is oftenest identical with the stem-vowel. Exampls: =a=-decl.:
=figgra-gulþ=, =hunsla-staþs=, =himina-kunds=, =fulla-tôjis=;
--=i=-decl.: =gasti-gôþs=, =naudi-bandi=; --=u=-decl.: =fôtu-baúrd=,
=hardu-haírtei=, =filu-waúrdei=.

But the connecting vowel of the =o=-stems is always =-a=; as,
=aírþa-kunds=, =hleiþra-stakeins=; the =-ja= of =ja=-stems persists
when the stem is a short syllabl, but it becums =i= when the stem
is long (cp. § 44); as, =wadja-bôkôs=, =alja-kuns=; =arbi-numja=,
=aglaiti-waúrdei=; in like manner =þûsundi-faþs=, < stem in =-jô-=,
nom. =þûsundi= (§ 145).

The =n=-stems hav simpl =a= insted of the thematic ending =-an=,
=-ôn=; as, =guma-kunds=, =fruma-baúr=, =wilja-halþei=, =qina-kunds=,
=auga-daúrô=; but =mari-saiws= (cp. Beitr., 8, 410).

  NOTE 1. The composition-vowel was often dropt in Gothic, especially
  that of the =a=-stems; e. g., of =a=-stems: =wein-drugkja= (but
  =weina-triu=, =weina-basi=, etc.), =gud-hûs=, =guþ-blôstreis=
  (but =guda-faúrhts=, =guda-laus=, =guþa-skaunei=), =laus-qiþrs=,
  =laus-handus= (but =lausa-waúrds=), =þiudan-gardi=, =háuh-þûhts=,
  =ain-falþs=, =þiu-magus= (for =þiwa-=, § 91, n. 3); --of
  =ja=-stems: =niuklahs= (but =niuja-satiþs=), =frei-hals=,
  =aglait-gastalds= (but =aglaiti-waúrdei=); --of =i=-stems:
  =brûþ-faþs=, =þut-haúrn= (Beitr., 8, 411), =twalib-wintrus= (§ 141).

  NOTE 2. Sum words show evasions of the composition-vowel:
  =þiuþi-qiss= (for =þiuþa-=); I. Cor. X, 16 (in Cod. A); =anda-laus=
  (for =andja-=); I. Tim. I, 4 (in A, but =andi-laus= in B);
  =hrainja-haírts= (for =hraini-=); Mt. V, 8; =garda-= in cpds.
  seems to be the normal form beside the stem =gardi-= (s. § 101):
  =garda-waldands=; Mt. X, 25. Lu. XIV, 21; =miþgarda-waddjus=; Eph.
  II, 14 (in B, but =midgardi-w.= in A); Beitr., 8, 432. Cp. also
  =brôþra-lubô=; Rom. XII, 10 (in A, but =brôþru-lubô=; I. Thess.
  IV, 9, in B).--The evasions occur mostly in Codex A and seem to
  be yunger East-Gothic forms; cp. the names in the Documents (e.
  g., =Gudi-lub=, in Ar. Doc.; =Sunjai-friþas=, in Neap. Doc.), and
  Wrede, 'Ostg.', 184.

  NOTE 3. Beside the other consonantal stems there occur:
  =brôþru-lubô= (§ 114); cp. the preceding note; =baúrgs-waddjus=,
  a genitiv-composition (§ 116); =nahta-mats= (§ 116); beside
  =mann-= (§ 117) the stem =mana-= is found: =mana-sêþs=,
  =mana-maúrþrja=, =unmana-riggws=; and (probably according to note
  1) =man-leika=.--=sigis-laun= and =þruts-fill=, which belong to old
  =s=-stems (s. § 94, n. 5.--Leo Meyer, Got. Spr., p. 174), may (by
  loss of =a=, according to note 1) also refer to =a=-stems.

  NOTE 4. For more about the cpds. in Gothic, s. Beitr., 8, 371-460;
  Brgm., II, 73 et seq.; Wrede, 'Ostg.', 183 et seq.


A. VOCALIC (STRONG) DECLENSION.


1. (a) A-Declension.

§ 89. The Gothic =a=-declension contains only masculins and neuters. We
distinguish between pure =a=-stems and =ja=-stems.

  NOTE. The =wa=-stems in Gothic differ but very litl from the pure
  =a=-stems. Their number is very small (§ 91, n. 3; § 93; § 94, n.
  1).


Masculins.

§ 90. Paradims of the masculins. (a) Pure =a=-stems: =dags=, _day_ (<
an erlier *dagaz, proethnic Germanic *dago-z, § 88, n. 2); =hlaifs=,
_(loaf of) bred_ (proethnic Germanic *hlaibo-z). (b) =ja=-stems:
=haírdeis=, _herdsman_ (proethnic Germanic *herdio-z); =harjis=, _army_
(proethnic Germanic *hario-z).

  Sing. N. =dags=      =hlaifs=    |   =haírdeis=     =harjis=
        G. =dagis=     =hlaibis=   |   =haírdeis=     =harjis=
        D. =daga=      =hlaiba=    |   =haírdja=      =harja=
        A. =dag=       =hlaif=     |   =haírdi=       =hari=
        V. =dag=       =hlaif=     |   =haírdi=       =hari=
                                   |
  Plur. A. =dagôs=     =hlaibôs=   |   =haírdjôs=     =harjôs=
        G. =dagê=      =hlaibê=    |   =haírdjê=      =harjê=
        D. =dagam=     =hlaibam=   |   =haírdjam=     =harjam=
        A. =dagans=    =hlaibans=  |   =haírdjans=    =harjans=

§ 91. Like =dags= decline many masculins; as, =stains=, _stone_;
=skalks=, _servant_; =tains=, _twig_; =himins=, _heven_; =fisks=,
_fish_; =wigs=, _way_; =wulfs=, _wolf_; =fugls=, _bird (fowl)_; =aiþs=
(gen. =aiþis=), _oath_.

=hlaifs= shows the hardening of the medial soft spirant when becuming
final (cp. §§ 56. 79). So does =laufs= (nom. pl. =laubôs=), _leaf_.

  NOTE 1. The declension of these masculins is identical with that of
  the masculin =i=-stems (100) in the hole sg. and in the gen. pl.
  Only the nom., acc., and dat. pl. can show to which declension they
  belong. Consequently, a number of masculins which ar not found in
  those pl. cases cannot with certainty be classified. The testimony
  of the other Germanic languages, however, wil in many cases
  enable us to decide. Thus =akrs=, _field_; =mêgs=, _sun-in-law_;
  =maúrgins=, _morning_; =snaiws=, _snow_; =maiþms=, _present_, etc.,
  belong to the =a=-decl.

  NOTE 2. Words which ar not found in the nom. sg. nor in the nom.
  acc. pl., may be neuter. Thus the nom. to the isolated gen.
  =akeitis= (_vinegar_) may be both =akeits= and =akeit=, that to the
  dat. =staþa= (_shore_) both =staþs= and =staþ=. Sum of such words
  ar undoutedly m., as is evident from the adjs. which modify them,
  or from the cognate dialects; e. g., =slêps=, _sleep_; =wôkrs=,
  _uzury_; =aúhns=, _oven_; =tweifls=, _dout_; =môþs=, _anger_ (gen.
  =môdis=, § 74).

  NOTE 3. According to the rules for final =w= (§ 42), =þius= and
  =þiu= ar givn, respectivly, as the nom. and voc. sg. to the nom.
  pl. =þiwôs= (_servants_), gen. =þiwê=--the only forms found. Cp.
  =þiu-magus=, _servant_, § 88ᵃ, n. 1.

  NOTE 4. According to § 78, n. 2, the =s= of the nom. sg. is dropt
  in =*ans= (dat. =anza=), _beam_; =*hals= (=halsis=), _neck_;
  =freihals=, _liberty_; =*ams= (acc. pl. =amsans=), _shoulder_:
  =waír=, _man_; =*gabaúr= (n. pl. =gabaúrôs=), _festiv meal_;
  =kaisar=, _emperor, Cæsar_; =stiur=, _steer_ (Neh. 5, 18; cp. Zs.
  fda., 37, 319).

  NOTE 5. =wêgs=, _wave_ (nom. pl. =wêgôs=, but dat. pl. =wêgim=);
  =aiws=, _time_ (dat. pl. =aiwam=, acc. pl. =aiwins=), show a
  tendency to merge into the =i=-decl.

§ 92. The =ja=-stems ar subject to the rules concerning the contraction
of the =ji= into =ei= (s. § 44, c and n. 1), according to which
there is a distinction between the words with long and those with
short stem-syllabls. Further exampls: (a) long-stemd and trisyllabic
(polysyllabic): =asneis=, _hired man_; =andeis=, _end_; =ƕaiteis=,
_wheat_; =sipôneis=, _disciple_; the words in =-areis= (Kluge,
Stammbildung, §§ 8. 9; ahd. gr., § 200): =laisareis=, _teacher_;
=bôkareis=, _scribe_, etc. (b) short stems: =niþjis=, _cuzin_;
=*andastaþjis=, _adversary_.

  NOTE 1. =andeis=, _end_, has in Rom. X, 18 the acc. pl. according
  to the =i=-decl.: =andins=.

  NOTE 2. Only in the pl. occurs: =bêrusjôs=, _parents_ (§ 33).

  NOTE 3. The acc. pl. =hlijans= (Mk. IX, 5) suggests the nom. sg.
  =*hleis= (like =freis=, § 126, n. 2), _tent_. Cp. Zimmer, QF., 13,
  308.

  NOTE 4. A nom. pl. =silbawiljôs=, adj. uzed as sb. (nom. sg.
  =*silba-wiljis=, _willing of one's self_; cp. =gawiljis=, § 126),
  occurs in II. Cor. VIII, 3.


Neuters.

§ 93. Paradims. (a) pure =a=-stems: =waúrd=, _word_; =haubiþ=, _hed_.
(b) =wa=-stems: =triu=, _tree_. (c) =ja=-stems: =kuni=, _kin_.

  Sing. N. =waúrd=     =haubiþ=    |  =triu=    |  =kuni=
        G. =waúrdis=   =haubidis=  |  =triwis=  |  =kunjis=
        D. =waúrda=    =haubida=   |  =triwa=   |  =kunja=
        A. =waúrd=     =haubiþ=    |  =triu=    |  =kuni=
                                   |            |
  Plur. N. =waúrda=    =haubida=   |  =triwa=   |  =kunja=
        G. =waúrdê=    =haubidê=   |  =triwê=   |  =kunjê=
        D. =waúrdam=   =haubidam=  |  =triwam=  |  =kunjam=
        A. =waúrda=    =haubida=   |  =triwa=   |  =kunja=

§ 94. Like =waúrd= ar declined a very great number of neuter nouns; e.
g., =blôþ=, =blôþis=, _blud_; =gulþ=, _gold_; =juk=, _yoke_; =jêr=,
_year_; =haúrn=, _horn_; =sauil=, _sun_; =silubr=, _silver_; =agis=,
_fear_; =sáir=, _sorrow_; =maúrþr=, _murder_; =gras=, =grasis=, _grass_.

Exampls of words, like =haubiþ=, with a final hard sound for a medial
soft spirant: =dius=, =diuzis=, _animal_; =hatis=, _hatred_; =riqis=,
_darkness_ (§ 78, n. 1); =liuhaþ=, =liuhadis=, _light_; =witôþ=, _law_.

  NOTE 1. According to § 42, the final =w= of =wa=-stems becums
  =u= after a short vowel. There occur two words of this kind: the
  paradim =triu= (=weina-triu=, _vine_) and =*kniu=, =kniwis=,
  _knee_. No change after a long vowel; as, =lêw=, _opportunity_;
  =fraiw=, _seed_.

  NOTE 2. According to § 91, n. 2, it is doutful whether sum words
  ar m. or n. The reasons givn there permit us to class words like
  =þaúrp=, _field_; =maþl=, _market_, with the neuters; doutful ar
  the forms =dal=, _dale_ (cp. ON. dalr), =lun=, _ransom_ (or =lûns=,
  cp. § 15, n. 1).

  NOTE 3. The word =guþ=, which is neuter in form, is uzed as m.
  when denoting the Christian God. But the n. pl. =guda= (_heathen_)
  _gods_ (cp. § 74, n. 4), is stil uzed. The inflection of the sg.
  is uncertain, because only abbreviated forms (§ 1, n. 4) occur:
  =g̅þ̅=, =g̅þ̅s̅=, =g̅þ̅a̅=. As ful forms ar givn: nom. acc.
  =guþ=, gen. =guþs=, dat. =guþa=, tho we should expect the gen.
  =gudis=, dat. =guda=. If the gen. form =guþs= is correct, the word
  =guþ= would belong to the consonantal stems (§ 114 et seq.).--In
  composition =guda-= and =guþa-=; s. § 88ᵃ, n. 1.

  NOTE 4. =fadrein=, '_paternity_', in the sense of '_parents_', may
  be uzed as an indeclinabl pl. with the art.: =þai fadrein=, =þans
  fadrein=. But also the regular neuter pl. =fadreina= occurs in the
  sense of '_parents_'. The fem. =fadreins=, _lineage, family_, is a
  separate word (§ 103).--Cp. J. Schmidt, 'Indog. Neutra', 14.

  NOTE 5. The gen. of =hatis=, _hatred_, occurs onse (in cod. B)
  as =hatis= (a consonantal form); Eph. II, 3 (=hatizê= in A). For
  a different view, s. Wrede, 'Ostg.', 77.--Concerning the neuters
  in =-is=, s. v. Bahder, 'Verbalabstracta', 52 et seq.; Kluge,
  Stammbild., §§ 84. 145; Brgm., II, 419 et seq. Cp. also § 78, n. 3.

§ 95. Like =kuni= ar declined both short and long =ja=-stems; e. g.,
=badi=, _bed_; =nati=, _net_; =faírguni=, _mountain_; =gawi=, =gaujis=,
_province_ (§ 42, n. 2); =taui=, =tôjis=, _deed_ (§ 26); =reiki=,
=reikjis=, _kingdom_; =arbi=, =arbjis=, _inheritance_; =galigri=,
_consummation of marriage_; =gawaúrki=, _business_; =garûni=,
_counsel_; =andwaírþi=, _presence_.

  NOTE 1. Beside =-jis= a contracted gen. in =-eis= (cp. § 44, c; §
  92) is found in but a few long and short stems; as, =trausteis=
  (nom. =trausti=, _cuvenant_); Eph. II, 12; =andbahti=, _office_,
  has the gen. =andbahtjis= (3 times) beside =andbahteis= (onse);
  Lu. I, 23; =gawaírþi=, _peace_, has =gawaírþjis= (6 times),
  =gawaírþeis= (3 times); =waldufni=, _power_, has =waldufneis=
  (Skeir., 49) beside =waldufnjis= (twice).


1. (b) Ô-Declension.

§ 96. The Gothic =ô=-declension contains only +feminins+ which serv as
a supplement to the =a=-decl. (§ 88, n. 1). Also here we distinguish
between pure =ô=-stems and =jô=-stems.

Paradims: (a) =giba=, _gift_ (stem =gibô-=). (b) long =jô=-stems:
=bandi=, _bond_ (stem =bandjô-=); =mawi=, _girl_ (stem =maujô-=).

  Sing. N. =giba=   |  =bandi=     =mawi=
        G. =gibôs=  |  =bandjôs=   =maujôs=
        D. =gibai=  |  =bandjai=   =maujai=
        A. =giba=   |  =bandja=    =mauja=
                    |
  Plur. N. =gibôs=  |  =bandjôs=   =maujôs=
        G. =gibô=   |  =bandjô=    =maujô=
        D. =gibôm=  |  =bandjôm=   =maujôm=
        A. =gibôs=  |  =bandjôs=   =maujôs=

§ 97. Like =giba= ar declined a great many words; as, =bida=,
_request_; =þiuda=, _peple_; =hansa=, _multitude_; =saiwala=, _soul_;
=stibna=, _voice_; =aírþa=, _erth_; =ƕeila=, _hour_; =wamba=, _belly_;
=mildiþa=, _mercy_; =aƕa=, _water_.

  NOTE 1. The declension of the =wô-= and short =jô=-stems is
  identical with that of =giba=; e. g., =triggwa=, _cuvenant_;
  =bandwa=, _sign_; --=sunja=, _truth_; =halja=, _hel_; =sibja=,
  _relationship_; =wrakja=, _persecution_; =plapja=, _street_.

  NOTE 2. The acc. sg. of =ƕeila= before the enclitic =-hun= is found
  as =ƕeilô-= in =ƕeilôhun=; s. § 163, n. 1 (as regards the form, cp.
  =ainôhun=, § 163, c; =ƕarjôh=, § 165).

§ 98. Like =bandi= go the long and polysyllabic =jô=-stems. Their
inflection is the same as that of =giba=, except in the nom. and voc.
sg. which hav =i= insted of =ja=.--Further exampls: =þiudangardi=,
_kingdom_; =ƕôftuli=, _glory_; =*haiþi=, _field, heath_; =*wasti=,
_garment_; =*frijôndi=, f., _frend_; =*fraistubni=, _temptation_.

  NOTE 1. Like =mawi= (for the change of =w= into =u=, s. § 42),
  whose inflection corresponds to that of =bandi=, inflects also
  =þiwi=, =þiujôs=, _maid-servant_.


2. I-Declension.

§ 99. The =i=-declension contains only masculins and feminins. Both
genders properly ought to inflect precisely alike. But this is the case
in the pl. only, while the sg. of the masculins has the gen. and dat.
after the analogy of the =a=-declension.


Masculins.

§ 100. Paradim: =balgs=, _wine-skin_ (proethnic Germanic =balgi-z=).

  Sing. N. =balgs=     Plur. N. =balgeis=
        G. =balgis=          G. =balgê=
        D. =balga=           D. =balgim=
        A. =balg=            A. =balgins=
        V. =balg=

§ 101. The number of masculins inflecting like =balgs= is not very
great; e. g., =gasts=, _guest_; =gards=, _house_; =muns=, _thought_;
=mats=, _meat, food_; =saggws=, _song_; =sauþs=, =saudis=, _sacrifice_;
=brûþ-faþs= (=d=), _bridegroom_; =staþs= (=d=), _sted, place_.

  NOTE 1. Words not occurring in the nom., dat., acc. pl. can not
  with certainty be referd to this declension (cp. § 91, n. 1). In
  many cases, however, we can infer from the remaining Germanic
  languages to what declension they belong. Accordingly, the word
  =saiws=, _sea, lake_, belongs here; and, particularly, a number of
  verbal abstracts like =qums=, _arrival_; =drus=, _fall_; =wlits=,
  _face_; =runs= (gen. =runis=), _a running_; =grêts=, _weeping_;
  =krusts=, _gnashing_.

  NOTE 2. The =s= of the nom. is dropt according to § 78, n. 2; e.
  g., =ur-runs=, =ur-runsis=; =drus=, =drusis=; =baúr=, =baúris= (<
  =baíran=, _to bear_), _sun_.

  NOTE 3. =naus=, _a ded person_, is explaind according to the rules
  for =w= (§ 42); nom. pl. =naweis=, acc. pl. =nawins=; so, also, the
  acc. and voc. sg. =nau=.

  NOTE 4. For =wêgs= and =aiws=, s. § 91, n. 5; for the acc. pl.
  =andins=, s. § 92, n. 1.


Feminins.

§ 102. Paradim: =ansts=, _favor_ (proethnic Germanic =ansti-z=).

  Sing. N. =ansts=         Plur. N. =ansteis=
        G. =anstais=             G. =anstê=
        D. =anstai=              D. =anstim=
        A. =anst=                A. =anstins=
        V. =anst=

§ 103. A great number of feminins belong to this class. Exampls:
=qêns=, _woman, wife_; =dails=, _deal_; =wêns=, _hope_; =nauþs=,
=nauþais=, _need_; =siuns=, _sight_; =sôkns=, _serch_; =taikns=,
_token_; =fahêþs=, =fahêdais=, _joy_; =magaþs= (=þ=), _maid_;
=fadreins=, _generation, family_; =arbaiþs= (=d=), _work_; =asans=,
_harvest_; =ahaks=, _duv_; those in =-duþs=, =-duþais= (perhaps
=-dûþs=; cp. § 15, n. 1): =mikilduþs=, _greatness_; =managduþs=,
_abundance_; =ajukduþs=, _eternity_; =gamainduþs=, _communion_.

Very numerous ar the verbal abstracts which may be formd from every
strong verb by means of the dental suffix =t= (=þ=, =d=); e. g.,
=gaskafts=, _creation_; =þaúrfts=, _need_; =ganists=, _salvation_;
=fralusts=, _loss_; =gakusts=, _test_; =gabaúrþs=, _birth_; =gataúrþs=,
_destruction_; =manasêþs= (=d=), _world_; =dêþs=, _deed_; =gahugds=,
_thought_.

  NOTE 1. Here belong also the abstracts in =-eins=, =-ôns=,
  =-ains=, derived from the weak verbs of the I., II., and III.
  Weak Conjugations, respectivly; e. g., =naseins= (< =nasjan=),
  _salvation_; =laiseins=, _doctrin_; =háuheins=, _a 'heightening'_,
  hense _praise_; =galaubeins=, _belief_; =naiteins=, _blasfemy_;
  =laþôns= (< =laþôn=), _invitation_; =salbôns=, _salv, ointment_;
  =mitôns=, _consideration_; =þulains= (< =þulan=), _suffering,
  patience_; =libains=, _life_.--But those in =-eins= hav the nom.
  and gen. pl. according to the =ô=-declension. Thus, for exampl:

  Sing. N. =naiteins=   G. =naiteinais=  D. =naiteinai=  A. V. =naitein=
  Plur. N. =naiteinôs=  G. =naiteinô=    D. =naiteinim=     A. =naiteinins=.

  So in one exampl also the dat. pl.: =unkaúreinôm=; II. Cor. XI,
  8.--The pl. of the abstracts in =-ôns=, =-ains= is regular:
  =mitôneis=, =mitônê=, etc.

  NOTE 2. Whether words ar f. or m. is doutful when they do not occur
  in a distinctiv case; as, =lists=, _craftiness_; =fulleiþs= (or
  =fulleiþ=, n.), _fulness_.

  NOTE 3. The =s= of the nom. is dropt according to § 78, n. 2;
  e. g., =us-stass=, =us-stassais=, _resurrection_; =garuns=,
  =-runsais=, _street_.

  NOTE 4. =haims=, _village_, forms its pl. according to the
  =ô=-declension: =haimôs=, etc.


3. U-Declension.


Masculins and Feminins.

§ 104. The masculins and feminins of the =u=-declension ar identical in
form. Paradim: =sunus=, _sun_.

  Sing. N. =sunus=      Plur. N. =sunjus=
        G. =sunáus=           G. =suniwê=
        D. =sunáu=            D. =sunum=
        A. =sunu=             A. =sununs=
        V. =sunu=

§ 105. Further exampls: (a) masculins; e. g., =áirus=, _messenger_;
=asilus=, _ass_; =dauþus=, _deth_; =wulþus=, _glory_; =hûhrus=,
_hunger_; =þaúrnus=, _thorn_; =haírus=, _sword_; =liþus=, _lim_;
=lustus=, _lust_; =magus=, _boy_; =faírƕus=, _world_; =fôtus=, _foot_;
=stubjus=, _dust_; =wrêþus=, _flock_ (§ 7, n. 3); in =-assus= (Kluge,
Stammbildg., § 137 et seq.): =draúhtinassus=, _warfare_; =ibnassus=,
_evenness_; =þiudinassus=, _kingdom_; in =-ôdus=, =-ôþus= (Kluge,
Stammbildg., § 134); e. g., =auhjôdus=, _tumult_; =gabaúrjôþus=,
_plezure_.

(b) The only feminins ar certainly only =handus=, _hand_; =kinnus=,
_cheek_; =waddjus=, _wall_ (cp. Beitr., 16, 318¹), and perhaps =asilus=
(if ὄνου in Lu. XIX, 30. Joh. XII, 15, means _she-ass_).

The gender of sum is doutful; as, =qaírnus=, _mil_; =flôdus=, _flud_;
=luftus=, _air_.

  NOTE 1. Foren words like =aggilus=, _angel_; =sabbatus=, _sabbath_,
  fluctuate in the pl. between the =u-= and =i=-decl.; s. § 120, n. 1.

  NOTE 2. There is a notewurthy fluctuation between =u= and =au=
  (=aú=? cp. § 24, n. 4) in the terminations of the sing. All cases
  of this kind hav been collected by Leo Meyer in his 'Got. Spr.',
  p. 574. =au= occurs for =u=: nom. =sunaus=; Lu. IV, 3; =faírƕaus=;
  Gal. VI, 14 (in cod. B = =faírƕus= in cod. A); =Bartimaiaus=;
  Mt. X, 46; --acc. =handau=; Mk. VII, 32; =þiudinassau=; Lu. IX,
  27; =haírau=; Rom. XIII, 4 (in A = =haíru= in Cod. Car.); --voc.
  =sunau= (often), =magau=; Lu. II, 48.

  Reversely we find =u= for =au=: gen. =dauþus=; Lu. I, 79; =wulþus=;
  Rom. IX, 23; =apaustaulus=; II. Cor. XII, 12 (in A = =apaustaulaus=
  in B); dat. =wulþu=; Lu. IX, 26; =Paítru=; Gal. II, 7 (in A =
  =Paítrau= in B).

  From the great number of exampls, however, we infer that the
  abuv paradim is by all means the regular one; the deviations
  just mentiond ar merely owing to confusion on the part of later
  copyists. When a word occurs in two manuscripts, it generally
  has the correct form in one. Especially in Cod. Amb. A and in the
  gospel of Lu. the =u=-decl. is confused in this way. Cp. Beitr.,
  18, 280¹.


Neuters.

§ 106. The word =faíhu=, _muney_ (orig. '_catl_', = OHG. fihu) is the
only neuter sb. of this class which occurs in several cases in the
singular. No n. pl. is found.

  N. =faíhu=
  G. [=faíháus=]
  D. =faíháu=
  A. =faíhu=

  NOTE 1. Also =gairu=, _sting_, is n. It occurs only in the nom. sg.
  (II. Cor. XII, 7 in A, as a gloss to =hnûþô=).--The sb. =leiþu=,
  _fruit-wine_, probably belongs here too; only the acc. sg. =leiþu=
  occurs (Lu. I, 15); cp. Gallée (§ 223, n. 1), I, p. 38.--The acc.
  sg. =sihu=, a gloss to the neuter =sigis=, _victory_, in Cod. B I.
  Cor. XV, 57, is probably miswritn for =sigu= (because the =i= in
  =sihu= would hav becum =aí=) which may also belong to a masculin
  (nom. sg. =*sigus= = OHG. sigu). But cp. J. Schmidt, 'Idg. Neutra',
  153.

  NOTE 2. The gen. =faíháus= has been inferd from the m. (f.) and
  from the adv. gen. =filaus= (§ 131, n. 3).


B. N-DECLENSION (WEAK DECLENSION).


1. Masculins.

§ 107. Paradim: =guma=, _man_.

  Sing. N. =guma=     Plur. N. =gumans=
        G. =gumins=         G. =gumanê=
        D. =gumin=          D. =gumam=
        A. =guman=          A. =gumans=

§ 108. Like =guma= inflect a great many masculins; e. g., =staua=,
_judge_; =hana=, _cock_; =skula=, _detter_; =mêna=, _moon_; =atta=,
_father_; =ahma=, _spirit_; =blôma=, _flower_; =milhma=, _cloud_;
=hliuma=, _hearing_; =weiha=, _priest_; =swaíhra=, _father-in-law_;
=magula=, _litl boy_; pl. =brôþrahans=, _brothers_ (J. Schmidt, 'Idg.
Neutra', 16); --=bandja=, _prisoner_; =haúrnja=, _trumpeter_; =fiskja=,
_fisher_; =timrja=, _carpenter_; =arbja=, _heir_; =wilja=, _wil_;
=manamaúrþrja=, _(man-)murderer_; =waúrstwja=, _workman_.

  NOTE 1. =aba=, _man_, has the gen. pl. =abnê=, dat. pl. =abnam=;
  of =aúhsa=, _ox_, occurs the gen. pl. =aúhsnê=. Cp. the neuters
  in § 110, n. 1. Onse (I. Cor. IX, 9) we meet with the acc. pl.
  =aúhsununs= which either stands for =aúhsuns= (according to § 80,
  n. 1; cp. Anz. fda. 6, 120) or for =aúhsnuns= (Beitr., 8, 115; 12,
  543; Brgm., I, 203).

  NOTE 2. The long stems in =-ja= do not contract the =ji= of the
  gen. and dat. sg. into =ei= (s. § 44, n. 1); hense, =bandja=, gen.
  =bandjins=, dat. =bandjin=.


2. Neuters.

§ 109. Paradim: =haírtô=, _hart_.

  Sing. N. =haírtô=       Plur. N. =haírtôna=
        G. =haírtins=           G. =haírtanê=
        D. =haírtin=            D. =haírtam=
        A. =haírtô=             A. =haírtôna=

§ 110. Like =haírtô= inflect but few substantivs: =augô=, _ey_; =ausô=,
_ear_; =barnilô=, _litl child_; =auga-daúrô=, _window_; =þaírkô=,
_hole_, _ear of a needl_; =kaúrnô=, _corn_; =sigljô=, _seal_. Cp. J.
Schmidt, 'Indog. Neutra', 106 et seq.

Also the weak adjectivs (§ 132).

  NOTE 1. Irregular forms occur in the pl. of the neuters =namô=,
  _name_, and =watô=, _water_. The sg. inflects like =haírtô=.
  Paradim:

  Sing. N. =namô=    G. =namins=   D. =namin=    A. =namô=
  Plur. N. =namna=   G. =namnê=    D. =namnam=   A. =namna=.

  The pl. of =watô= occurs only in the dat. =watnam=. Cp. § 108, n. 1.

  NOTE 2. To the dat. sg. =sunnin= which occurs (twice) in the frase:
  =at sunnin urrinnandin= (Mk. IV, 6. XVI, 2), belongs perhaps a
  neuter =sunnô= (not a m. =sunna=), beside the f. =sunnô=, _sun_
  (§ 112).--Cp. Mahlow, 'Die langen vocale a, e, o', p. 156, and
  Sievers' comments on this in the appendix to the 3d G. edition of
  this grammar.

  NOTE 3. The word =gajukô= which was formerly regarded as n., is f.,
  '_a female cumpanion_'. Cp. Bernhardt's 'Vulfila', comment on Phil.
  IV, 3.


3. Feminins.

§ 111. The feminins of the =n=-declension ar divided into two classes:
stems in =-ôn-= and =-ein-=. Their inflection is the same. Paradims:
=tuggô=, _tung_; =managei=, _multitude_.

  Sing. N. =tuggô=       =managei=
        G. =tuggôns=     =manageins=
        D. =tuggôn=      =managein=
        A. =tuggôn=      =managein=

  Plur. N. =tuggôns=     =manageins=
        G. =tuggônô=     =manageinô=
        D. =tuggôm=      =manageim=
        A. =tuggôns=     =manageins=

§ 112. Like =tuggô= inflect many substantivs; as, =qinô=, _woman_,
_wife_; =ûhtwô=, _dawn_; =swaíhrô=, _mother-in-law_; =azgô=, _ashes_;
=gatwô=, _street_; =staírnô=, _star_; =wikô=, _week_; =sunnô=, _sun_
(cp. § 110, n. 2); --=arbjô=, _heiress_; =brunjô=, _brestplate_;
=tainjô=, _basket_; =niþjô=, _female cuzin_; =raþjô=, _account_.

  NOTE 1. Also the feminins of the weak adjectivs inflect like
  =tuggô= (§ 132).

§ 113. Nearly all substantivs inflecting like =managei= ar derived
from adjectivs. Such an abstract in =-ei= may be formd from every
adjectiv, hense the great number of these words; e. g., =diupei=,
_depth_; =laggei=, _length_; =bleiþei=, _mercy_; =mikilei=,
_greatness_; =braidei=, _bredth_; =frôdei=, _wisdom_; =hardu-haírtei=,
_hard-hartedness_; =drugkanei=, _drunkenness_; sum can not be referd
to corresponding adjs., but they likewise denote a state; e. g.,
=þaúrstei=, _thirst_; =magaþei=, _maidenhood_. But very few hav
a concrete meaning; as, =aiþei=, _mother_; =þramstei=, _locust_;
=kilþei=, _womb_; =marei=, _sea_; =ƕaírnei=, _skul_.

  NOTE 1. There is a close resemblance between adjectival abstracts
  in =-ei= and the verbal abstracts in =-eins= (cp. § 103, n.
  1); e. g., =háuhei=, _height_ (< =háuhs=), but =háuheins=, _a
  heightening_, _praise_ (< =háuhjan=). Both hav the acc. sg.
  =háuhein=.

  In one case there is confusion. In Jo. X, 33 we meet with a gen.
  sg. =wajamêreins= (nom. =wajamêreins=, _blasfemy_) from which it is
  customary to infer a nom. =wajamêrei=, tho in its meaning such a
  form is impossibl.

  NOTE 2. In Cod. B. three nominativs sg. in =-ein= ar found:
  =liuhadein=, _illumination_; II. Cor. IV, 4 (=liuhadeins= in A;
  comp. this passage in Bernhardt's 'Vulfila'); =wiljahalþein=,
  _favor_; Col. III, 25 (wanting in A); =gagudein=, _piety_; I. Tim.
  IV, 8 (=gagudei= in A).

  NOTE 3. The comparativs, the superlativs in =-ma=, and the prs.
  participls form their feminin like =managei= (cp. § 132, n. 4).


C. MINOR DECLENSIONS.

(REMAINS OF CONSONANTAL DECLENSIONS.)

§ 114. Nouns in =-r= denoting relationship. The words =brôþar=,
_brother_; =daúhtar=, _daughter_; =swistar=, _sister_; =fadar=,
_father_, hav replaced their old consonantal inflection in the nom.,
acc., and dat. pl. with the forms of the =u=-declension (§ 104).
Paradim:

  Sing. N. =brôþar=     Plur. =brôþrjus=
        G. =brôþrs=           =brôþrê=
        D. =brôþr=            =brôþrum=
        A. =brôþar=           =brôþruns=

  NOTE. Cp. the cpd. =brôþru-lubô=, _brotherly luv_ (§ 88ᵃ, n. 3; §
  210, n. 1).

§ 115. The present participls in Gothic inflect like weak adjectivs (§
133). An older (substantival) inflection, however, persists with sum
participls uzed substantivly. Paradim: =nasjands=, _savior_.

  Sing. N. =nasjands=      Plur. =nasjands=
        G. =nasjandis=           =nasjandê=
        D. =nasjand=             =nasjandam=
        A. =nasjand=             =nasjands=
        V. =nasjand=                --

Furthermore: =fijands=, _fiend_; =frijônds=, _frend_ (> =frijôndi=, §
98), =daupjands=, _the Baptist_; =mêrjands=, _preacher_; =bisitands=,
_neighbor_; =talzjands=, _teacher_; =-waldands=, _ruler_ (=all-w.=,
_the Almighty_; =garda-w.=, _master of the house_); =fraweitands=,
_avenger_; =fraujinônds=, _ruler_; =midumônds=, _mediator_; =gibands=,
_giver_. Cp. Zs. fdph., 5, 315.

§ 116. +A number of feminins+ following in sum cases the =i=-decl.
(=ansts=, § 102) appear in others as short forms which ar remains of an
old consonantal inflection. Paradim: =baúrgs=, (_burg_), _town_, _city_.

  Sing. N. =baúrgs=     Plur. N. =baúrgs=
        G. =baúrgs=           G. =baúrgê=
        D. =baúrg=            D. =baúrgim=
        A. =baúrg=            A. =baúrgs=

Like =baúrgs= inflect also =alhs=, _templ_; =spaúrds=, _race-course_;
=brusts=, _brest_; =dulþs=, _feast_; =waíhts=, _thing_; =miluks=,
_milk_; =mitaþs= (=d=), _mezure_.

The word =nahts=, _night_, inflects in the sg. like =baúrgs=, in the
pl. only the dat. =nahtam= is found. Cp. =nahta-mats=, § 88ᵃ, n. 3.

  NOTE 1. =waíhts= and =dulþs= chiefly follow the =i=-declension;
  hense, g. sg. =waíhtais=, =dulþais=. According to the cons.
  declension occur onse each the dat. sg. =dulþ= and acc. pl.
  =waíhts=. Beside =waíhts= there is a n. nom. sg. =waíht= in the
  combination =ni-waíht=, _nothing_.

§ 117. Masculins with short (consonantal) cases: =manna=, _man_;
=mênôþs=, _month_; =reiks=, _ruler_; =weitwôds=, _witness_ (cp. § 74,
n. 2). But in point of inflection they ar not fully alike.

(1) =manna= follows in sum cases the =n=-decl. (=guma=, § 107). These
cases ar here put in Italics:

  Sing. N. _manna_      Plur. N. =mans=, _mannans_
        G. =mans=             G. =mannê=
        D. =mann=             D. _mannam_
        A. _mannan_           A. =mans=, _mannans_

  NOTE 1. To =manna= belongs the cpd. =*alamans= (_all men_),
  found in the dat. pl. =alamannam= (Skeir.) only; also the neuter
  =gaman= (_cumpanion, cumpany_) which inflects, however, in all the
  extant forms (nom. acc. sg. =gaman=, dat. sg. =gamana=, dat. pl.
  =gamanam=) precisely like =waúrd= (§ 93).

  NOTE 2. In composition the stem =mana-= (=man-=) appears; s. § 88ᵃ,
  n. 3.

(2) =mênôþs= and =reiks= follow in the g. sg. the =a=-decl.: =mênôþis=,
=reikis=, but in the dat. sg. the short forms =mênôþ= and =reik=
(Eph. II, 2) occur. In the nom. acc. pl. the short forms =mênôþs= and
=reiks= ar uzed; gen. pl. =reikê=. In the dat. pl. =mênôþum=, but
=reikam=.--Beside the nom. sg. =weitwôds= there occur the acc. sg.
=weitwôd= and the g. pl. =weitwôdê=.

  NOTE 3. The g. sg. =mênôþis= (Neh. VI, 15) is not quite certain;
  Löbe red =mênôþs=.

  NOTE 4. Here belongs also the nom. =bajôþs=, dat. =bajôþum=, _both_
  (s. § 140, n. 1).

§ 118. The neuter =fôn=, _fire_, has this form in the nom. acc. sg.,
but =funins= in the gen., and =funin= in the dat.--No plural occurs.
Cp. § 12, n. 3.

  NOTE 1. Concerning the neuter genitivs =guþs= and =hatis=, s. § 94,
  n. 3, and § 94, n. 5, respectivly.


APPENDIX.

DECLENSION OF FOREN WORDS.

§ 119. A number of foren words from the Latin and Greek wer fully
adopted into the Gothic language thru commercial and political
intercourse, so that their inflection is the same as that of purely
Gothic words; e. g., =pund=, n., _pound_; =marikreitus=, m., _perl_;
=Krêks=, m., _Greek_; =karkara=, f., '_carcer_'; =alêw=, n., _oil_;
=kaisar=, m., _Cæsar_.

§ 120. A second portion of foren words wer at a later period forced on
the Gothic language by Christianity and especially by the version of
the Bible. To these belong for the most part proper nouns which ar stil
felt to be foren elements and hav but imperfectly adopted the Gothic
inflection. For their treatment in Gothic no fixt rules can be givn.
Sumtimes they retain their Greek inflection, sumtimes they take either
similar or arbitrarily formd case-endings.--Cp. Bernhardt's 'Vulfila',
p. XXVIII, and especially M. H. Jellinek, 'Beitr. zur erklärung der
german. flexion' (Berlin 1891), pp. 76-84.

  NOTE 1. Most consistent is the treatment of the Gr. masculins in
  -ος, Lt. -us, which inflect in Gothic according to the =u=-decl.
  (§§ 104, 105); e. g., =Paítrus=, =Barþaúlaúmaius=, =Teitus=,
  =aípiskaúpus=, ἐπίσκοπος; =apaústaúlus=, ἀπόστολος; =aggilus=,
  ἄγγελος; =sabbatus=, _sabbath_. But only in the sg. pl. forms
  follow mostly the =i=-decl.; e. g., =apaústaúleis=, =sabbatins=,
  =aggileis=, =aggilê= beside =aggiljus=.

  NOTE 2. Greek case-endings ar retaind in the neuters
  =alabalstraún=, ἀλάβαστρον; =praitôriaún=, πραιτώριον, etc.;
  =Israêleitês= has the nom. pl. =Israêleitai= = Ἰσραηλῖται; Rom. IX,
  4; or (with Gothic inflection) =Israêleiteis=; II. Cor. XI, 22.

  NOTE 3. The following exampl may illustrate arbitrary inflection.
  The Gr. ἐπιστολή is represented in Goth. by =aípistaúlê=
  (nom. sg.). But the dat. sg. is =aípistaúlein=, the dat. pl.
  =aípistaúlêm=, and the acc. pl. =aípistaúlans=.




CHAP. II. DECLENSION OF ADJECTIVS.


§ 121. In Gothic, as in all other Germanic languages, adjectivs hav two
kinds of inflection, the +strong+ and the +weak+. The strong inflection
is the original one corresponding to that of the cognate languages,
the weak originated on Germanic soil. Every normal adj. may hav both a
strong and a weak inflection. The distinction is a syntactic one: the
+weak+ form is employd after the articl (rarely in other positions),
the +strong+ form in all other cases, especially when the adj. is uzed
predicativly, or attributivly without the articl. Cp. Zs. fda., 18,
17-43.


A. STRONG ADJECTIVS.

§ 122. The strong inflection of adjectivs is in part the same as the
vocalic (or strong) inflection of the substantivs with which it was
originally identical. In Germanic, however, sum cases of the adj. hav
adopted the pronominal inflection, so that the identity between the
adjectival inflection and that of the substantivs is now confined to
certain cases. The nom. and acc. sg. of the neuter gender hav two forms
of the same value, a substantival and a pronominal one (in =-ata=). The
latter, however, is not uzed predicativly.

The Gothic adjectiv, like the substantiv, has three vocalic
declensions: (1) Adjectivs of the =a=-declension which correspond to
the substantival =a=-declension in the m. and n. (§ 89 et seq.) and in
the f. of the =ô=-declension (§ 96 et seq.).--A subdivision is formd by
the =ja=-stems, just as in the case of the corresponding substantivs.
(2) Adjectivs of the =i=-declension which correspond to the substantivs
in §§ 99-103. (3) Adjectivs of the =u=-declension belonging to the
substantivs in §§ 104-106.

Classes (2) and (3), however, contain but very few remains in Gothic.
The few adjectival =ja=-stems hav in most of the inflectional cases
past over to the 1st class, so that the normal strong declension of
the adjectivs in Gothic embraces only the =a=-declension and its
subdivision, the =ja=-stems.

  NOTE. Subject to +strong+ inflection ar all pronouns (except =sama=
  and =silba=, § 132, n. 3), the cardinal numbers, inasmuch as they
  inflect adjectivly, and =anþar=, _the second_; also the adjectivs
  of a more general meaning: =alls=, _all_; =ganôhs=, _enuf_;
  =halbs=, _half_; =midjis=, '_medius_'; =fulls=, _ful_.

§ 123. Paradim of the strong adjectival declension: =blinds=, _blind_.
The pronominal forms differing from the inflection of the corresponding
substantivs ar in the following paradim put in Italics:

  Sing.     M.           N.               |     F.
     N.  =blinds=    =blind=, _blindata_  |  =blinda=
     G.        =blindis=                  |  _blindaizôs_
     D.        _blindamma_                |  =blindai=
     A.  _blindana_  =blind=, _blindata_  |  =blinda=
                                          |
  Plur.                                   |
     N.  _blindai_   =blinda=             |  =blindôs=
     G.        _blindaizê_                |  _blindaizôs_
     D.        _blindaim_                 |  _blindaim_
     A.  =blindans=  =blinda=             |  =blindôs=

§ 124. Here belong most of the extant adjectivs; e. g., =hails=,
_hole, helthy_; =siuks=, _sik_; =juggs=, _yung_; =triggws=, _tru,
faithful_; =swinþs=, _strong_; =ubils=, _evil_; =aiweins=, _eternal_;
=haiþiwisks=, _wild_; =mahteigs=, _mighty_; =ansteigs=, _gracious_;
=manags=, _much, many_; =môdags=, _angry_; =handugs=, _wise_.--Also
adjectiv pronouns; as, =meins=, _mine, my_; =þeins=, _thine, thy_;
=seins=, _his_; =jains=, _yun_; the superlativs (§ 137) and pps. pass.;
as, =numans=, _taken_; =nasiþs=, _saved_ (cp. § 134).

  NOTE 1. According to § 78, n. 2, the =s= of the nom. sg. is
  dropt, (1) after =s=; e. g., =swês=, =swêsis=, _own_; =gaqiss=,
  =gaqissis=, _consenting_. (2) after =r= preceded by a short vowel:
  =anþar=, _the second, the other_; =unsar=, _our_; =izwar=, _your_;
  =ƕaþar=, _which of the two_. Accordingly, the nom. pl. =warai= must
  hav had a nom. sg. =war=, _wary_.

  NOTE 2. The rules for the hardening of final soft spirants (79)
  must be noted; as, =frôþs=, =frôdis=, _wise_; =gôþs=, =gôdis=,
  _good_ (§ 74); =liufs=, =liubis=, _dear_; =daufs=, =daubis=, _def_
  (§ 56, n. 1).

  NOTE 3. Stems having a =w= before the case-endings ar subject to
  the rule for final =w= (§ 42) in the nom. sg. m. and n. The three
  words of this kind occur only in other cases. Therefore the noms.
  pl. =fawai=, =qiwai=, =usskawai= suggest as noms. sg. m. and n.
  =faus=, =fau=, _few_; =qius=, =qiu=, _alive_; =usskaus=, =usskau=,
  _wakeful_. According to =usskawjan= (_to awake_, § 42, n. 2), also
  =usskaws= might be supposed insted of =usskaus=. For =lasiws=, s. §
  42, n. 1.

  NOTE 4. The pronominal adjectivs in =-ar=: =unsar=, =izwar=,
  =anþar=, =ƕaþar=, hav in the n. sg. only the shorter forms:
  =unsar=, =izwar=, etc.

§ 125. Adjectiv-stems with =ja= before the endings (=ja=-stems) hav
most of their forms like the paradim =blinds=. Only in few forms a
change is caused by the =j=. As in the case of nouns, we distinguish
between short and long adjectival =ja=-stems.

Paradim of a short =ja=-stem: =midjis=, _midl_:

  Sing.      M.                N.           |    F.
        N. =midjis=      =midi=, =midjata=  |  =midja=
        G.        =midjis=                  |  =midjaizôs=
        D.        =midjamma=                |  =midjai=
        A. =midjana=     =midi=, =midjata=  |  =midja=

  Plur.                                     |
        N. =midjai=      =midja=            |  =midjôs=
        G.        =midjaizê=                |  =midjaizô=
        D.        =midjaim=                 |  =midjaim=
        A. =midjans=     =midja=            |  =midjôs=

§ 126. As regards inflection, the m. =midjis= is closely related to the
substantiv =harjis= (§§ 90. 92), the n. =midi= to the substantiv =kuni=
(§§ 93. 95). The fem. =midja= shows no deviation whatever.

Only a small number of adjectivs belong to this class: =aljis=,
_another_; =sunjis=, _tru_; =ga-wiljis=, _unanimous_; =unsibjis=,
_criminal_; =-fraþjis=, _minded_ (only in =grinda-=, =sama-fr.=);
=ƕarjis= (§ 160); also those whose stems end in a vowel (§ 44, c):
=niujis=, _new_; =-tôjis=, _doing_ (as, =ubiltôjis=, _evil-doing_).

  NOTE 1. On account of the small number of these adjs. sum forms of
  the abuv paradim ar not extant. Thus, the short form of the neuter
  =midi= is givn in conformity with the long stems (§ 127), and that
  of =niujis= would be =niwi=; only =niujata= occurs; the n. of
  =-tôjis= would be =-taúi= (§ 26, a).

  NOTE 2. The adj.-stem =frija-=, _free_, which occurs in the f. sg.
  =frija=, =frijaizôs=, =frijai=, =frija=, and in the m. forms, acc.
  sg. =frijana=, nom. pl. =frijai=, acc. =frijans=, has a contracted
  nom. sg. m. =freis= (for =frijis=). Also the gen. sg., if extant,
  would be =freis=.

  NOTE 3. The nom. sg. f. of =niujis= is =niuja= (contrary to =þiwi=,
  § 98, n. 1).

§ 127. The long =ja=-stems inflect in the pl. like =midjis=. Paradim
=wilþeis= (stem =wilþja-=), _wild_, in the sg.:

  Sing.       M.             N.               |    F.
        N. =wilþeis=     =wilþi=, =wilþjata=  |  =wilþi=
        G.    [=wilþeis= or =wilþjis=?]       |  [=wilþjaizôs=]
        D.        =wilþjamma=                 |  =wilþjai=
        A. =wilþjana=    =wilþi=, =wilþjata=  |  =wilþja=

§ 128. The infl. of the m. is related to that of the sb. =haírdeis= (§§
90. 92), the infl. of the f. to that of =bandi= (§§ 96. 98; only =wôþi=
occurs; II. Cor. II, 15). None of the few adjs. of this class occurs in
the gen. sg.; =wilþjis= (Rom. XI, 24) probably stands for =wilþjins=;
s. § 132, n. 1.

Further exampls: =alþeis=, _old_; =faírneis=, _old_; =aírzeis=,
_astray_; =wôþeis=, _sweet_.

§ 129. According to § 122, only remains of the original adjs. of the
=i-= and =u=-declension ar extant in Gothic, viz.: nom. sg. of all
genders, acc. sg. n., and gen. sg. m. and n. All other extant cases hav
past over to the inflection of the =ja=-stems (§§ 125-127). The same
rule applies to the weak forms (§ 132, n. 1).

  NOTE. The old form of the gen. sg. [m.] n. is seen in =skeiris=
  (Skeir. 45) for the =i=-decl., in =filaus= (§ 131, n. 3) for the
  =u=-decl.; the latter, of course, is only a partial proof for the
  adj.

§ 130. The adjectival =i=-stems ar connected with the substantivs
=balgs=, =ansts= (§§ 99-103). Exampls: =hrains=, _clean_; =gamains=,
_common_; =brûks=, _uzeful_; =analaugns=, _hidn_; =anasiuns=, _visibl_;
=andanêms=, _agreeabl_; =andasêts=, _abominabl_; =sêls=, _kind_
(=unsêls=, _wicked_); =suts=, _sweet_; =skeirs=, _clear_; =gafáurs=,
_sober_ (=unfáurs=, _talkativ_); =aljakuns=, _of different kind_. The
paradim =hrains= inflects thus:

  Sing.       M.              N.                  |     F.
        N. =hrains=        =hrain= [=hrainjata=]  |  =hrains=
        G.        [=hrainis=]                     |  [=hrainjaizos=]
        D.        =hrainjamma=                    |  =hrainjai=
        A. =hrainjana=     =hrain= [=hrainjata=]  |  =hrainja=

  Plur.                                           |
        N. =hrainjai=      =hrainja=              |  =hrainjôs=
           etc.                                   |

  NOTE 1. A gen. sg. f. as wel as a longer n. form (like =hrainjata=)
  ar not extant.

  NOTE 2. A word may with certainty be referd to this class, (1)
  if it occurs in the nom. sg. f. (=hrains=), (2) if besides the
  nom. sg. m. and n. also cases with =j= ar found. But if only the
  nominativs m. and n. (=hrains=, =hrain=) occur, the word may
  inflect like =blinds= (123); if only =j=-cases (as, =hrainjamma=)
  ar found, it may decline like =wilþeis=, =midjis= (§§ 127.
  125).--Other adjectivs, however, ar without sufficient proof, but
  for other considerations, included in this class; e. g., =skauns=,
  _beutiful_; =auþs=, _desolate_, _waste_; =hauns=, _base_; =bleiþs=,
  _merciful_; =gadôfs=, _fit_; =*mêrs=, _famous_ (in =wailamêr=,
  nom. sg. n.).--Cp. Kluge, Stammbildg., §§ 178. 197. 229-231;
  Beitr., 14, 167; 15, 489; Brgm., II, 287.

  NOTE 3. Adjectival =i=-stems may be inferd from adverbs in =-iba=
  (§ 210); e. g., =arniba=, =gatêmiba=.

§ 131. The adjectival =u=-stems ar related to the substantivs =sunus=
(fem. =handus=), =faíhu= (§§ 104-106). Exampls: =hardus=, _hard_;
=qaírrus=, _meek_; =þaúrsus=, _dry_; =tulgus=, _stedfast_; =manwus=,
_redy_; =aggwus=, _narrow_; =aglus=, _difficult_; =seiþus=, _late_;
=þlaqus=, _tender_; =twalibwintrus=, _twelv years_ (lit. _winters_)
_old_. Paradim =hardus=:

  Sing.       M.             N.                      F.
        N. =hardus=       =hardu=, =hardjata=  |  =hardus=
        G.       [=hardaus=?]                  |  [=hardjaizôs=]
        D.       [=hardjamma=]                 |  [=hardjai=]
        A. =hardjana=     =hardu=, =hardjata=  |  =hardja=

  Plur.                                        |
        N. =hardjai=      [=hardja=]           |  =hardjôs=
           etc.                                |

  NOTE 1. Whether adjectivs belong to this class is seen from the
  nom. sg. in which the abuv adduced exampls occur (the only f.
  forms being =þaúrsus= and =tulgus=; Beitr., 15, 570; 16, 318).
  =laushandus=, _empty-handed_; =hnasqus=, _soft_; =kaúrus=, _hevy_,
  ar merely inferd from their =ja=-cases.

  NOTE 2. From the adv. =glaggwuba= (§ 210) an adj. =glaggwus= (§ 68)
  can be inferd.

  NOTE 3. The original adj. =*filus=, _much_, is preservd in Goth. in
  the nom. acc. sg. n. uzed substantivly and adverbially: =filu=, the
  gen. =filaus= being uzed adverbially.


B. WEAK ADJECTIVS.

§ 132. The weak declension of adjectivs is fully identical with the
weak or =n=-declension of nouns (§§ 107-112). But it must be noticed
that the f. of the weak adj. inflects like the paradim =tuggô= (cp. §
112, n. 1).--Exampl of an inflected weak adj. (=blinds=, § 123):

  Sing.       M.             N.             F.
        N. =blinda=       =blindô=    |  =blindô=
        G.        =blindins=          |  =blindôns=
        D.        =blindin=           |  =blindôn=
        A. =blindan=      =blindô=    |  =blindôn=

  Plur.                               |
        N. =blindans=     =blindôna=  |  =blindôns=
        G.        =blindanê=          |  =blindônô=
        D.        =blindam=           |  =blindôm=
        A. =blindans=     =blindôna=  |  =blindôns=

  NOTE 1. Like =blinda= inflect all weak adjectivs. Of =ja=-stems:
  nom. sg. =niuja=, =niujô=, =niujô= (cp. § 126), =wilþja= (§ 127);
  --=i=-stems: =hrainja=, =hrainjô=; =u=-stems: =hardja=, =hardjô=
  (cp. § 129 et seq.).--In the cases with =i= (gen. dat. sg. m. n.)
  of the long stems in =-ja-= (=-i-=, =-u-=) the forms with =-ji-=
  appear as the regular ones (as in the sb., § 108, n. 2; contrary
  to § 44, c); cp. =wilþji(n)s=; Rom. XI, 24; =unhrainjin=; Mk.
  IX, 25. Lu. VIII, 29; =unsêljin=; Mt. V, 39. Jo. XVII, 15. But
  beside =unsêljins=; Eph. VI, 16 (in A) =unsêleins= (in B); beside
  =faírnjin=; Mk. II, 21. Lu. V, 36, also =faírnin=; II. Cor. VIII,
  10. IX, 2.

  NOTE 2. Sum adjectivs occur only in the weak forms; as, =usgrudja=,
  _idle, despondent_; =alaþarba=, _poor_; =usfaírina=, _blameless_;
  =inkilþô=, _pregnant_, and a few more of which sum ar probably to
  be regarded as substantivs (cp. Zs. fda., 18, 41, note).--The weak
  form =ainaha= (no strong form occurs), _only_, has in Lu. VIII, 42
  the nom. sg. f. =ainôhô= (cp. Beitr., 12, 203) which is certainly
  incorrect for =ainahô=.

  NOTE 3. All ordinals except 1st and 2nd (cp. § 146), and the prns.
  =sama= and =silba= (§ 156) follow the +weak+ inflection only.

  NOTE 4. Lastly, the prs. ptcs. (§ 133), comparativs (§ 136), and
  the superlativs in =-ma= (§ 139) inflect exclusivly like weak adjs.
  But all these words hav the f. according to the paradim =managei=
  (§ 113, n. 3).


C. DECLENSION OF THE PARTICIPLS.

§ 133. The present participl has lost its strong inflection and
declines like a weak adj., but with the f. in =-ei= (§ 132, n. 4). Only
the nom. sg. m. has frequently both the strong and the weak inflection.
Paradim =gibands=, _giving_:

  Sing.    M.           N.       |     F.
     N. =gibands= }  =gibandô=   |  =gibandei=
        =gibanda= }              |
     G.       =gibandins=        |  =gibandeins=
     D.       =gibandin=         |  =gibandein=
     A. =gibandan=   =gibandô=   |  =gibandein=
                                 |
  Plur.                          |
     N. =gibandans=  =gibandôna= |  =gibandeins=
     G.       =gibandanê=        |  =gibandeinô=
     D.       =gibandam=         |  =gibandeim=
     A. =gibandans=  =gibandôna= |  =gibandeins=

  NOTE 1. Concerning the shorter inflection of sum participls uzed
  substantivly, s. § 115.

§ 134. The prt. ptc. pass., like an ordinary adj., follows the strong
and weak inflection; e. g., the pp. of the stv. =giban=:

  Strong:  m. =gibans=  n. =giban=, =gibanata=  f. =gibana=
  Weak:       =gibana=     =gibanô=                =gibanô=

The pp. of the wv. =nasjan=:

  Strong: m. =nasiþs=   n. =nasiþ=, =nasidata=   f. =nasida=
  Weak:      =nasida=      =nasidô=                 =nasidô=

  NOTE. Concerning the interchange between =þ= and =d= in the pp. of
  the weak verbs, s. § 74.


D. COMPARISON OF ADJECTIVS.


_1. COMPARATIV._

§ 135. The comparativ degree of adjectivs in Gothic is formd by means
of two suffixes, =-iz-= and =-ôz-=, to which the terminations of the
weak adjectivs ar added.

The formation with the suff. =-iz-= is more general than the other.
It is found in adjs. of all kinds; e. g., =managiza= (< =manags=,
=a=-stem), =alþiza= (< =alþeis=, §§ 127. 128), =hardiza= (< =hardus=,
§ 131).--But the suffix =-ôz-= occurs in =a=-stems only: =frôdôza= (<
=frôþs=), =swinþôza= (< =swinþs=).

  NOTE. The adj. =juggs=, _yung_, has the compar. =jûhiza= (according
  to § 50, n. 1). Its superlativ is not extant.

§ 136. The comparativs inflect exactly like weak adjectivs, but the f.
ends in =-ei= (§ 132, n. 4):

  Sing. N. m. =frôdôza=   n. =frôdôzô=   f. =frôdôzei=
        G.          =frôdôzins=             =frôdôzeins=,

etc., like the prs. ptc. (§ 133).


_2. SUPERLATIV._

§ 137. The superlativ degree, like the comparativ, is formd in two
ways, in =-ist-= or in =-ôst-=; e. g., =managists= (< =manags=),
=armôsts= (< =arms=, _poor_). The inflection of the superlativs is
precisely the same as that of ordinary adjectivs--strong and weak.

  NOTE. No rule can be givn for the appearance of the =ô= or the =i=
  in the suffix, except that the =ô=-form occurs only with =a=-stems.
  We may suppose that a word which forms the compar. by means of
  =i=, has =i= in the superl. also, and that, in like manner, the
  =ô=-forms correspond to each other. This supposition, however, is
  only founded on a few extant exampls.


_3. IRREGULAR COMPARISON._

§ 138. The lack of comparison of sum adjectivs is supplied by
comparativs and superlativs with a corresponding meaning, but without a
positiv:

  =gôþs= (=d=), _good_   Compar. =batiza=     Superl. =batists=
  =ubils=, _evil_           "    =waírsiza=      "       --
  =mikils=, _great_         "    =maiza=         "    =maists=
  =leitils=, _litl_         "    =minniza=       "    =minnists=
  =sineigs=, _old_          "       --           "    =sinista=.

§ 139. A superlativ with an =m=-suffix is found in six words, which
ar derived from adverbial stems and appear without a positiv. The
=m=-suffix is either simpl: =fru-ma=, =innu-ma=, =aúhu-ma=, or
compound: =af-tuma=, =if-tuma=, =hlei-duma=.

Two of them hav assumed a comparativ meaning: =aúhuma=, _higher_;
=hleiduma=, _left_ (ἀριστερός); the others hav a superlativ or an
intensiv signification: =aftuma=, _the last_; =iftuma=, _the next_;
=innuma=, _the inmost_; =fruma=, _the first_.

These words follow the weak inflection, but hav the f. in =-ei=,
exactly like the comparativs.

  NOTE. Sum superlativs in =-ma= ar compared anew in the uzual
  manner: =aftumists=, _the last_; =aúhumists=, oftener than
  =aúhmists= (cp. OE. ŷmest, Sievers-Cook, OE. Gr., § 314, n. 3),
  _the highest_; =frumists=, _the first_.--The forms =hindumists=,
  _hindmost_, =spêdumists=, _last_ (< =*spêþs=, beside =spêdiza=,
  =spêdists=), suggest the missing =hinduma= and =spêduma=. Also
  =miduma=, =midst=, =midumônds=, _mediator_, point to a form
  =*miduma=, _midl_ (cp. OE. meodume, midmest).




CHAP. III. NUMERALS.


1. CARDINALS.

§ 140. The first three numerals ar declinabl in all cases and genders.

1. =ains=, n. =ain= and =ainata=, f. =aina=, inflects entirely like a
strong adj. (=blinds=, § 123). Plural forms mean _only_, _alone_. No
weak inflection is found. (§ 122, n. 1).

  2.        M.        N.          F.
       N. =twai=    =twa=    |  =twôs=
       G.     =twaddjê=      |    --
       D.     =twaim=        |  =twaim=
       A. =twans=   =twa=    |  =twôs=
                             |
  3.   N.   --      =þrija=  |    --
       G.     =þrijê=        |    --
       D.     =þrim=         |    --
       A. =þrins=   =þrija=  |  =þrins=

The nom. of the m. and f., which is not extant, may with certainty be
givn as =þreis=.

  NOTE. The definit dual number '_both_', ἀμφότεροι, is renderd by
  =bai=, which inflects like =twai=. The extant forms ar nom. m.
  =bai=, dat. =baim=, acc. =bans=, nom. acc. n. =ba=.--There occurs
  also an extended form with the same meaning, its inflection being
  that of a consonantal substantiv (§ 117, n. 4): nom. =bajôþs=, dat.
  =bajôþum=.

§ 141. The numerals from 4 to 19 ar of one gender. Extant ar: =fidwôr=,
_4_; =fimf=, _5_; =saíhs=, _6_; =sibun=, _7_; =ahtau=, _8_; =niun=,
_9_; =taíhun=, _10_; =ainlif= (§ 56, n. 1), _11_; =twalif=, _12_;
=fidwôrtaíhun=, _14_; =fimftaíhun=, _15_. These numerals ar uzed
uninflected, but may take an inflected gen. and dat. according to the
=i=-declension (§ 99 et seq.). Thus, =fidwôr=, dat. =fidwôrim=; =niun=,
gen. =niunê=; =taíhun=, dat. =taíhunim=; =ainlif=, dat. =ainlibim=;
=twalif=, gen. =twalibê=, dat. =twalibim=.

  NOTE. For =fidwôr= appears =fidur-= (s. § 24, n. 2) in cpds.:
  =fidurfalþs=, _fourfold_; =fidurdôgs=, _time of four days_;
  =fidurragineis=, _tetrarch_. Cp. Beitr., 6, 394; Brgm., III, 11.

§ 142. The tens from 20 to 60 ar formd by means of the pl. =tigjus=
(< =*tigus=, _a decad_), preceded by the units. =tigjus= inflects
regularly like =sunus= (§ 104). The object counted is always givn in
the gen.--=twai tigjus=, _20_; =*þreis tigjus=, _30_ (extant in gen.
=þrijê tigiwê=, acc. =þrins tiguns=), =fidwôr tigjus=, _40_; =fimf
tigjus=, _50_; =saíhs tigjus=, _60_.

§ 143. From 70 to 100 =-têhund= takes the place of =tigjus=:
=sibuntêhund=, _70_; =ahtautêhund=, _80_; =niuntêhund=, _90_;
=taíhuntêhund= and =taíhuntaíhund=, _100_. The numerals in =-têhund=
ar substantivs which ar as a rule indeclinabl. Onse (Lu. XV, 7)
we meet with an inflected gen. sg.; =in niuntêhundis jah niunê
garaíhtaizê=.--Cp. Brgm., III, 40.

§ 144. The hundreds ar formd by means of the plural of a neuter =hund=
(_a hundred_). The following ar extant: =twa hunda=, _200_; =þrija
hunda=, _300_; =fimf hunda=, _500_; =niun hunda=, _900_.

§ 145. =þûsundi=, _1000_, is a f. sb. (inflecting like =bandi=, § 96),
with a gen. pl.; several thousands ar exprest by =þûsundjôs=.--Onse
(Ezra II, 14) occurs a n. pl. =twa þûsundja=. Cp. ahd. gr., § 275. OE.
Gr., § 327, and Mahlow, 'Die langen Vocale', p. 98.

The extant thousands ar: =twôs þûsundjôs=, _2000_; =.g. þûsundjôs=,
_3000_; =fidwôr þûsundjôs=, _4000_; =fimf þûsundjôs=, _5000_; =taíhun
þ.=, _10000_; =miþ twaim tigum= (dat.) =þûsundjô= (gen.), _with 20000_.

  NOTE (to §§ 141-145). The numerals ar very often denoted by letters
  (cp. § 1, n. 2). Therefore so many words for numerals ar wanting.


2. ORDINALS.

§ 146. The first two ordinals differ in point of stem from the
corresponding cardinals. 1. m. =fruma=, n. =frumô=, f. =frumei= (s. §
139), and the superl. =frumists=, _first_ (§ 139, n. 1). 2. =anþar=,
_second, other_, inflects like a strong adj. (§ 122, n. 1; § 124,
ns. 1. 4).--All subsequent ordinals ar derived from the cardinals
and inflect like weak adjectivs (§ 132, n. 3). The extant ordinals
ar: =þridja=, _3d_; =*fimfta= (only in 15th), _fifth_; =saíhsta=,
_6th_; =ahtuda=, _8th_; =niunda=, _9th_; =taíhunda=, _tenth_;
=fimftataíhunda=, _15th_. Only the second component is declined: dat.
sg. (=in jêra=) =fimftataíhundin=; Lu. III, 1.


3. OTHER NUMERALS.

§ 147. A distributiv numeral is =tweihnai=, _two apiece, two-and-two_,
extant in the dat. f. =tweihnaim= and acc. f. =tweihnôs=.

  NOTE. All other distributivs ar exprest by means of the cardinals
  along with =ƕazuh=, =ƕarjizuh= (§§ 164. 165) or the prep. =bi=;
  as (=insandida ins=) =twans ƕanzuh=, _two and two_; Lu. X, 1; =bi
  twans=; I. Cor. XIV, 27.

§ 148. Multiplicativs ar formd by means of the adj. =falþ-=:
=ainfalþs=, _onefold_; =fidurfalþs=, _fourfold_; =taíhuntaíhund-falþs=,
_hundredfold_; =managfalþs=, _manifold_.

§ 149. Numeral adverbs answering the question 'how many times', 'how
often'? ar exprest by the dat. sg. =sinþa= or by the dat. pl. =sinþam=
(nom. sg. =sinþs=, _time_, lit. '_a going_') preceded by the cardinals:
=ainamma sinþa=, _onse_; =twaim sinþam=, _twice_; =þrim sinþam=,
_thrice_; =fimf s.=, _five times_; =sibun s.=, _seven times_.--With an
ordinal numeral: =anþaramma sinþa=, _a second time_.

  NOTE. Also the n. =þridjô=, _a third time_, is uzed adverbially
  (II. Cor. XII, 14).




CHAP. IV. PRONOUNS.


1. PERSONAL PRONOUNS WITHOUT GENDER (REFLEXIV).

§ 150.

         1. Person.        2. Person.       Reflexiv.
  Sing. N.  =ik=             =þu=               --
        G.  =meina=          =þeina=          =seina=
        D.  =mis=            =þus=            =sis=

  NOTE 1. =ugkis=, =igqis=, etc., are also speld =uggkis=, =iggqis=;
  cp. § 67, n. 1.

  NOTE 2. The nom. du. 2nd pers. is not extant; it was undoutedly
  =jut=. For =jus= (=jûs=?), s. § 15, n. 1.

§ 151. From the stems of these pronouns adjectivs ar derived, the
so-calld possessiv pronouns. 1st pers.: m. =meins=, n. =mein=,
=meinata=; f. =meina=, _my_ (_mine_); 2nd pers.: =þeins=, _thy_
(_thine_); refl. =seins=, _his_. Plurals: 1st pers. =unsar=, _our_; 2nd
pers. =izwar=, _your_. The only extant dual poss. prn. is =igqar=, the
1st pers. would be =ugkar=.

  NOTE 1. The inflection of these pronominal adjectivs is identical
  with that of the strong adj.; concerning =unsar=, =izwar=, cp. §
  124, ns. 1 and 4.--No weak inflection occurs.

  NOTE 2. The reflexiv =*seins= occurs only in the gen., dat., acc.;
  insted of the nominativs of all genders and numbers the genitivs
  of the prn. of the 3d pers. (=is=, =izôs=; =izê=, =izô=; § 152) ar
  employd.

  NOTE. The acc. and gen. pl. n. and the nom. pl. f. ar not extant,
  but the inferd forms ar undoutedly correct.


3. DEMONSTRATIV PRONOUNS.

§ 153. The simpl dem. prn. =sa=, =sô=, =þata= is uzed both as dem.
prn., _this_, _that_ (for the Gr. οὗτος or αὐτός), and, with a weakend
force, as articl, _the_. The latter uze is predominant.--The neuter
sing. (like the interrog., § 159) has preservd the instrumental case.

  Sing.      M.           N.     |    F.
        N. =sa=         =þata=   |  =sô=
        G.       =þis=           |  =þizôs=
        D.       =þamma=         |  =þizai=
        A. =þana=       =þata=   |  =þô=

  Instr.     --         =þê=     |    --

  Plur.                          |
        N. =þai=        =þô=     |  =þôs=
        G.       =þizê=          |  =þizô=
        D.       =þaim=          |  =þaim=
        A. =þans=       =þô=     |  =þôs=

  NOTE 1. The final =a=s of the dissyllabic forms ar dropt in
  combination with enclitics beginning with a vowel; cp. § 4, n.
  1.--For =þei= from =*þa-ei=, s. § 157, n. 2.

  NOTE 2. The instr. n. =þê= is preservd only in the combinations
  =bi-þê=, =du-þê= (=duþþê=), =jaþ-þê= (§ 62, n. 3), =þêei= (§ 157,
  n. 1), and, like =þana= (in =þanamais=, =þanaseiþs=), before a
  comparativ (= E. 'the' in 'the more').

§ 154. A compound demonstrativ pronoun is formd by affixing the
enclitic particl =-uh= to the simpl demonstrativ. Cp. § 24, n. 2. Its
meaning is always that of the simpl =sa= uzed demonstrativly, _this_,
_that_ (= Gr. οὗτος or αὐτός).--It inflects thus:

  Sing.      M.           N.     |    F.
        N. =sah=        =þatuh=  |  =sôh=
        G.       =þizuh=         |  [=þizôzuh=]
        D.       =þammuh=        |  [=þizaih=]
        A. =þanuh=      =þatuh=  |  [=þôh=]

  Plur.                          |
        N. =þáih=       [=þôh=]  |  [=þôzuh=]
        G.       [=þizêh=]       |  [=þizôh=]
        D.       [=þaimuh=]      |  [=þaimuh=]
        A. [=þanzuh=]   [=þôh=]  |  [=þôzuh=]

  NOTE 1. The forms in square brackets ar not extant.

  NOTE 2. The instr. n. =þêh= occurs only in the adv. =bi-þêh=.

§ 155. A defectiv demonstrativ pronoun =hi-= (nom. =*his= = =is=, §
152), _this_, occurs only in temporal frases in the dativ m. and n.
=himma= and in the acc. m. =hina=, n. =hita=; e. g., =himma daga=,
_to-day_; =und hina dag=, _to this day_; =und hita=, _til now_.

§ 156. =jains= (concerning the vowel =ai=, cp. § 20, n. 4), n.
=jainata=, f. =jaina= (_yon_), _that_, inflects like a strong adj.
(=blinds=, § 124).

Like weak adjectivs inflect =silba=, _self_, and =sama=, _same_, or
with the articl: =sa sama=, _the same_ (cp. § 132, n. 3).


4. RELATIV PRONOUNS.

§ 157. A simpl relativ pronoun is not found in the Gothic language.
A relativ prn. of the 3d pers. is formd from the simpl demonstrativ
pronoun by affixing the particl =ei= which, when uzed independently,
has the force of a conjunction, _that, in order that_. This relativ
pronoun inflects as follows:

  Sing.      M.                 N.    |    F.
        N.  =saei=            =þatei= | =sôei=
        G.          =þizei=           | =þizôzei=
        D.          =þammei=          | =þizaiei=
        A.  =þanei=           =þatei= | =þôei=
                                      |
  Instr.     --               =þêei=  |   --
                                      |
  Plur.                               |
        N.  =þaiei=           =þôei=  | =þôzei=
        G.          =þizêei=          | [=þizôei=]
        D.          =þaimei=          | =þaimei=
        A. =þanzei=           =þôei=  | =þôzei=

  NOTE 1. The instr. n. =þêei= is uzed only as a conjunction.

  NOTE 2. Beside =þatei= occurs =þei=, which is employd, however,
  only in combination with =ƕah= (§ 164, n. 1), and (like =þatei=) as
  a conjunction, _that_. Cp. Beitr., 4, 467; 6, 402; Zs. fda., 29,
  366 et seq.

  NOTE 3. Insted of the nom. sg. =saei=, m., =sôei=, f., also =izei=,
  m., =sei= (i. e. =si-ei=, § 10, n. 2), f., (formd from the 3d pers.
  of the pers. prn., § 152) ar employd. The form =sei= occurs even
  more frequently than =sôei=. Sumtimes =izei= stands as nom. pl.
  m. (for =eizei= which is not found); e. g., =þai izei bimaitanai
  sind=; Gal. VI, 13.--For =izei= the form =izê= is often found; cp.
  § 17, n. 1.

  NOTE 4. Concerning the change of final =s= before =ei= into =z=, s.
  § 78, c.

§ 158. When a relativ clause refers to a prn. of the 1st or 2nd pers.,
the relativ particl is affixt to the respectiv pers. prn. Thus, =ikei=,
_who_ (1st pers. sg.); --=þuei=, _who_; =þuzei=, _to whom_ (as in Mk.
I, 11); =þukei=, _whom_ (2nd pers. sg.); --=juzei=, _who_; =izwizei=,
_to whom_ (2nd pers. pl.).


5. INTERROGATIV PRONOUNS.

§ 159. The interrogativ pronoun =ƕas=, _who?_ (= Lt. quis), is formd
from the simpl interrogativ stem =ƕa-=. A substantiv following =ƕas=
occurs always in the genitiv; e. g., =ƕa mizdônô=, τίνα μισθόν; Mt. V,
46.

  Sing.      M.              N.   |    F.
        N. =ƕas=            =ƕa=  |  =ƕô=
        G.         =ƕis=          |  [=ƕizôs=]
        D.         =ƕamma=        |  =ƕizai=
        A. =ƕana=           =ƕa=  |  =ƕô=

  Instr.     --             =ƕê=  |   --

  NOTE 1. The gen. f. is not extant. The instr. occurs only in the
  neuter (cp. =sa=, § 153).

  NOTE 2. =ƕas= has no plural; cp. however =ƕanzuh=, § 164, n.

  NOTE 3. =ƕas= is also employd as an indefinit prn.; cp. § 162, n. 2.

§ 160. From stem =ƕa-= ar derived: =ƕaþar=, _which of two?_, and
=ƕarjis=, _which?_ A substantiv following is always put in the gen.
Both words inflect like strong adjectivs--=ƕaþar= like =anþar= (cp.
§ 124, n. 1), =ƕarjis= like =midjis= (§ 125), f. =ƕarja=, the n.
=*ƕarjata= like =ƕarjatôh= (§ 165).

§ 161. Compound interrogativs: =ƕileiks=, _what sort of?_, '_qualis?_'
(its correlativ being =swaleiks=, _such_, '_talis_'), and =ƕêlauþs=,
f. =ƕêlauda=, _how great?_, '_quantus?_' (correlativ =swalauþs=, _so
great_, '_tantus_'). These words inflect like a strong adjectiv.

  NOTE. =ƕeleiks= (in Lu. I, 29), for =ƕileiks=, is probably miswritn
  (according to § 10, n. 5).


6. INDEFINIT PRONOUNS.

§ 162. The Goth. indefinit pronoun =sums=, f. =suma=, n. =sum=,
=sumata=, =sum= (Gr. τις, τι), inflects like a strong adjectiv and is
uzed adjectivly; with the meaning _sum one, a certain one_, it is also
uzed substantivly.

  NOTE 1. An enumerativ expression is =sums...sums= (= Gr. ὁ μέν...ὁ
  δέ). In most cases =uh= (§ 24, n. 2) is added to the second
  =sums=, occasionally also to the first; as, =sumai...sumáih=, or
  =sumáih...sumáih=, _sum ... others_.

  NOTE 2. Also the interrogativ =ƕas= (§ 159) is very often uzed as
  an indefinit prn., _anyone_.

§ 163. The enclitic particl =-hun= is uzed to form indefinit pronouns
which occur only with the negativ particl =ni=. Their meaning is _no
one, none_.

(a) The singular of =manna=, _man_ (§ 117), with the suffix =-hun=
means _no one_.--The extant forms ar:

  n. =ni mannahun=,
  d. =ni mannhun=,
  g. =ni manshun=,
  acc. =ni mannanhun=.

(b) =ni ƕashun= (< =ƕas=, § 159), uzed substantivly, _no one_. It
occurs in the nom. sg. m. only.--An analogon to =ƕashun= is =ƕanhun= (<
=ƕan=, § 214, n. 1).

(c) =ni ainshun=, the commonest indef. prn., is uzed substantivly (_no
one, none_) and adjectivly (_no, not any_). A following sb. occurs
always in the (partit.) gen.; e. g., =ni ainshun þiwê=, _no servant_;
Lu. XVI, 3.--The declension of =ainshun= differs in sum cases from that
of the simpl form =ains= (§ 140).

  Sing.      M.                      N.     |    F.
        N. =ainshun=               =ainhun= | =ainôhun=
        G.           =ainishun=             |    --
        D.           =ainummêhun=           | =ainaihun=
        A. =ainnôhun= }            =ainhun= | =ainôhun=
           =ainôhun=  }                     |

  NOTE. =-hun= is also affixt to the acc. sg. of the sb. =ƕeila= (§
  97, n. 2): =ƕeilôhun=, _for an hour_ (=ni ƕeilôhun=, οὐδὲ πρὸς
  ὥραν; Gal. II, 5).

§ 164. '_Every_' is renderd by affixing =-uh= to the interrogativ
pronouns.

(a) =ƕazuh=, _every_. A noun or prn. following takes the gen. Its
inflection differs in part from that of the simpl form =ƕas= (§ 159):

  Sing.      M.                  N.   |    F.
        N. =ƕazuh=             =ƕah=  |  =ƕôh=
        G.           =ƕizuh=          |    --
        D.           =ƕammêh=         |    --
        A. =ƕanôh=             =ƕah=  |    --

  Plur.                               |
        A. =ƕanzuh=               --  |    --

In the pl. only the acc. =ƕanzuh= occurs.

  NOTE 1. The indef. relativ '_whoever, whosoever_' (Lt. quicunque)
  is renderd: (1) by =ƕazuh saei= or, with =sa= prefixt, =saƕazuh
  saei=. For =saei= also =izei= is found (§ 157, n. 3).--These
  forms ar uzed in the nom. sg. only, the nom. n. =þataƕah þei=
  (=þei= = =þatei=, § 157, n. 2) occurs twice: Jo. XV, 7. 16.--(2)
  by =þisƕazuh= followd by =saei= or =ei= in all cases; the first
  component, =þis=, remains uninflected: m. n. =þisƕazuh saei=, dat.
  =þisƕammêh saei=, acc. =þisƕanôh saei=; --nom. acc. n. =þisƕah þei=
  (or =þatei=), gen. =þisƕizuh þei=, dat. =þisƕammêh þei=.

  NOTE 2. Here may be observd the adverbs: =ƕêh= (instr. of =ƕazuh=),
  _at least, at any rate, only_, and =þisƕaduh þei=, _whithersoever_,
  =þisƕaruh þei=, _wheresoever_ (cp. =ƕaþ=, =ƕar=, § 213, n. 1).

§ 165. (b) =ƕarjizuh=, _every, each_.

  Sing.     M.          N.        |    F.
     N.  =ƕarjizuh=  =ƕarjatôh=   |    --
     G.        =ƕarjizuh=         |    --
     D.        =ƕarjammêh=        |    --
     A.  =ƕarjanôh=  [=ƕarjatôh=] | =ƕarjôh=

  NOTE. =ƕarjizuh= is also compounded with (uninflected) =ain=:
  =ainƕarjizuh=, _every one, every, each_, n. =ainƕarjatôh=, dat.
  =ainƕarjammêh=, etc.

§ 166. _Each of two_ is renderd by =ƕaþaruh=; it occurs only in the
dat. =ƕaþarammêh= (Skeir. 46), for the evidently incorrect =ƕaþaramma=
(cp. Bernhardt's comment on this passage); --also with =ain-=
prefixt (cp. § 165, n. 1): =ainƕaþaruh=, _each one of two_ (only
=ainƕaþarammêh= occurs; Skeir. 41).




CHAP. V. CONJUGATION.


GENERAL REMARKS.

§ 167. The Gothic verb has the following forms:

1. Two voices, Activ and Midl. The Activ Voice alone has preservd a
great variety of forms. The Midl Voice is retaind in but a few forms of
the prs. indicativ and optativ, which occur, however, very often. The
midl forms hav a passiv meaning. Therefore the Midl Voice is also calld
Passiv or Medio-Passiv Voice.

  NOTE 1. The lost passiv forms ar supplied by the pp. along with the
  corresponding forms of =waírþan= or =wisan=; e. g., =daupjada=, _he
  is baptized_, but =daupiþs was= or =warþ=, _he was baptized_. Cp.
  Zs. fdph., 5, 409 et seq.

  NOTE 2. The originally inchoativ verbs in =-nan= (§ 194) frequently
  hav a medial meaning (§ 194).

2. Two tenses, Present and Preterit (Perfect). The Preterit is the
general tense for the past. The future is wanting; its place is mostly
supplied by the present, seldom by means of auxiliary verbs (=skulan=,
_shal_; =haban=, _hav_; =duginnan=, _to begin_).

3. Two complete moods, Indicativ and Optativ (also calld Subjunctiv).
An Imperativ occurs only in the present; it has the second persons of
all three numbers and a 1st pers. pl.--There ar but few instances of a
3d pers. sg. and pl. imper. This is uzually exprest by the 3d pers.
opt. But also the 2nd and 1st pers. imp. ar frequently exprest by the
opt.

4. Three numbers: Singular, Dual, and Plural. The 3d pers. du. is
wanting.

5. The Present Infinitiv, the Present Participl with an activ meaning,
and the Preterit Partic. with a passiv meaning.

§ 168. The Gothic verbs ar, from a Germanic point of view, divided
according to the formation of the preterit in relation to the present
into two chief classes:


I. STRONG VERBS.

The strong verbs do not form the preterit with an additional suffix,
but by change of the radical vowel or by reduplication. Thus, we hav
two subdivisions:

1. Ablaut Verbs. The preterit of these verbs is formd without
reduplication. It differs from the present only by a regular change of
the radical vowel, the so-calld ablaut (cp. § 29); e. g., =binda=, _I
bind_, =band=, _I bound_.

2. Reduplicating Verbs. The prt. has reduplication, but no ablaut; e.
g., =halda=, _I hold_, =haíhald=, _I held_.

3. Reduplicating Ablaut Verbs. A smaller number of verbs hav the prt.
both with ablaut and reduplication; e. g., =lêta=, _I let_; =laílôt=,
_I let_ (prt.).


II. WEAK VERBS.

The weak verbs form the preterit by the addition of a suffix beginning
with a dental consonant; e. g., =nasja=, _I save_, =nasida=, _I saved_.
This suffixal element, =-da=, was formerly regarded as a form of the
verb 'do' (Germanic dôn), wherefore the weak prt. was also calld
'compound preterit'.

The weak verbs (except a few) ar derivativ verbs. According to their
formativ suffixes, which ar best preservd in the preterit forms, they
ar divided into four classes: (1) Suffix =i= (in the present =j=):
=nasja=, =nasi-da=. (2) Suffix =ô=: =salbô=, =salbô-da=. (3) Suffix
=ai= (in the present in part obscured): =haba=, =habai-da=. (4) Suffix
=nô= (in the present =n=): =fullna=, =fullnô-da=.

  NOTE. The small number of verbs which can not be referd to the two
  chief classes must, according to this classification, be considerd
  'irregular'.


I. STRONG VERBS.


_A. INFLECTION OF THE STRONG VERBS._

§ 169. The inflection of the strong verbs (by means of personal
endings) is the same in all three classes (§ 168). Therefore we first
giv the paradims of inflection and then discuss the formation of the
tense-stems (which is different in each class). As paradims may serv
a reduplicating verb, =haitan=, _to be calld_, and two ablaut verbs,
=niman=, _to take_, and =biudan=, _to offer_.

  Likewise =giban=, =gif=, =gaf= (cp. § 56).

  NOTE 2. The termination of the 2nd pers. sg. prt. (=-t=) causes
  the change stated in the rule for consonants before dentals (§
  81). Final =b= of stems becums =f=: =gaft= (inf. =giban=); exampls
  for =pt= ar wanting: =skôpt= or =skôft=? (inf. =skapjan=); --=g=
  remains unchanged in =magt= (§ 66, n. 1), other exampls ar wanting;
  neither ar there any exampls for =kt= (=wôkt= or =wôht=? cp. § 58,
  n. 2); --dentals becum =s=: =warst= < =waírþan=, =qast= < =qiþan=

  extant 2nd pers. prt. of =saísô= (inf. =saian=) is =saísôst=. On
  account of the scarcity of exampls it is uncertain whether all
  stems ending in a vowel had =-st=.--The 2nd pers. prt. of =rinnan=
  is =rant= (§ 80).

  NOTE 3. Only one strong verb is found (twice) in the 3d pers. sg.
  imper.: =atsteigadan=, καταβάτω; Mt. XXVII, 42. Mk. XV, 32 (cp. §

  to the weak verb (§ 192, n. 1).

  NOTE 4. The dual forms of the verb occur very seldom. The 1st pers.
  du. opt. prt., =nêmeiwa=, etc., which is only givn according to the
  corresponding form of the prs. =nimaiwa=, is not found at all. Also
  the 2nd pers. du. opt. prt. is but an inferd form according to the
  anomalous =wileits= (§ 205).

_B. TENSE-FORMATION OF THE STRONG VERBS._


1. Ablaut Verbs.

§ 171. The ablaut verbs form their tense-stems by a regular change of
the radical vowel, the so-calld ablaut. The several ablaut-series and
the conditions of their appearance wil be found givn in §§ 30-35. To
each of these series belong ablaut verbs, and therefore six ablaut
classes must be distinguisht. Each ablaut verb contains four ablaut
vowels which appear in the formation of the verb in the following
manner: (1) The first vowel belongs to the present and to what is
connected with the present (prsp., inf., also medio-passiv). (2) The
second vowel is that of the sg. prt. indic. (3) The third vowel appears
in the du. and pl. prt. indic. and thruout the prt. opt. (4) The fourth
vowel belongs to the pp.

In order to determin the inflection of a strong verb, it is customary
to giv the following four forms (principal parts): (1) 1st pers. sg.
prs. indic., or the prs. inf.; (2) 1st pers. sg. prt. indic.; (3) 1st
pers. pl. prt. indic.; (4) the pp.

In the following we arrange the ablaut verbs according to their classes.

§ 172. Class I. Verbs of the first ablaut series: =ei=--=ái=--=i=
(=aí=) (cp. § 30); e. g., =greipa=, =graip=, =gripum=, =gripans=, _to
gripe, seiz_; =i= before =h= (=ƕ=) becums =aí= by breaking (§ 20):
=leiƕa=, =láiƕ=, =laíƕum=, =laíƕans=, _to lend_.

  NOTE 1. Like these inflect: =deigan=, _to knead_; =steigan=, _to
  mount_; =gateihan=, _to show_; =þeihan=, _to thrive_; =þreihan=,
  _to throng_; =weihan=, _to fight_; --=beitan=, _to bite_;
  =dis-kreitan=, _to tear to pieces_; =ga-smeitan=, _to smear_;
  =-weitan= (=inweitan=, _to wurship_; =fraweitan=, _to punish_);
  =beidan=, _to wait_; =leiþan=, _to go_; =sneiþan=, _to cut_;
  --=weipan=, _to crown_; =dreiban=, _to drive_; =bi-leiban=, _to
  remain_; =sweiban=, _to cease_; --=reisan=, _to rize_; =skeinan=,
  _to shine_; =hneiwan=, _to decline, bow_; =speiwan=, _to spit_.

  NOTE 2. The =n= of =keinan= (OHG. kînan), _to germinate_, occurs
  only in the prs. stem (cp. § 206, b); the pp. is =kijans= (only in
  =uskijanata=; Lu. VIII, 6). The prt. =*kai=, =*kijum=, has been
  replaced by a weak prt. of the IV. weak conjugation (=keinôda=, §
  195, n. 2). Cp. Kluge, 'Germ. Conjug.', 143.

  NOTE 3. The verb =neiwan=, _to hav a quarrel against_, occurs only
  in a sumwhat doutful exampl: =naiw=; Mk. VI, 19. Cp. Bernhardt,
  'Vulfila', p. 282, and Zs. fdph., 7, 112. 484.

§ 173. Class II. Verbs of the second ablaut series: =iu=--=au=--=u=
(=aú=)--=u= (=aú=) (cp. § 31); e. g., =biuda=, =bauþ=, =budum=,
=budans=, _to offer_; with breaking (§ 24): =tiuha=, =táuh=, =taúhum=,
=taúhans=, _to draw, lead_.

  NOTE 1. Like =tiuhan= inflect: =siukan=, _to be sick_; =biugan=,
  _to bend_; =driugan=, _to perform military service_; =liugan=, _to
  lie_; =þliuhan=, _to flee_; --=giutan=, _to pour_; =usþriutan=,
  _to trubl, vex_; =niutan=, _to enjoy_; =liudan=, _to grow_;
  --=dis-hniupan=, _to break to pieces_; =sliupan=, _to slip_;
  =af-skiuban=, _to shuv away_; =hiufan=, _to weep_; =driusan=, _to
  fall_; =kiusan=, _to choose_; =fra-liusan=, _to lose_; =kriustan=,
  _to gnash_.

  NOTE 2. The vowel of the prs. is irregular in =lûka=, =lauk=,
  =lukum=, =lukans=, _to lock_.

§ 174. Class III. Verbs of the third ablaut series: =i=
(=aí=)--=a=--=u= (=aú=)--=u= (=aú=) (cp. § 32); e. g., =binda=, =band=,
=bundum=, =bundans=, _to bind_; with breaking (§§ 20. 24): =waírpa=,
=warp=, =waúrpum=, =waúrpans=, _to throw, cast_.

  NOTE 1. Like these inflect: =brinnan=, _to burn_; =du-ginnan=, _to
  begin_; =af-linnan=, _to depart_; =rinnan=, _to run_; =spinnan=,
  _to spin_; =winnan=, _to suffer_; --=trimpan=, _to tred_;
  --=fra-slindan=, _to devour_; =windan=, _to wind_; =hinþan=, _to
  cach_; =finþan=, _to find_; =þinsan=, _to draw_; --=stiggan= (only
  by conjecture in Mt. V, 29), _to sting_; =bliggwan=, _to beat_
  (§ 68, 2); =siggwan=, _to sing_; =sigqan=, _to sink_; =stigqan=,
  _to thrust_; =drigkan=, _to drink_; --=gildan=, _to be of value_;
  =swiltan=, _to die_; =hilpan=, _to help_; =filhan=, _to hide_;
  =wilwan=, _to rob_; --=baírgan=, _to hide, keep_; =gaírdan=,
  _to gird_; =waírþan=, _to becum_; =ga-þaírsan=, _to wither_;
  =swaírban=, _to wipe_; =ƕaírban=, _to walk_; --=þriskan=, _to
  thresh_; =ga-wrisqan=, _to bear fruit_ (these two only in the prs.
  tense, in I. Tim. V, 18. Lu. VIII, 14).

  NOTE 2. According to its prs. tense, also =briggan= would belong
  here; s. § 208.

§ 175. Class IV. Verbs of the fourth ablaut series: =i=
(=aí=)--=a=--=ê=--=u= (=aú=) (cp. § 33); e. g., =nima=, =nam=, =nêmum,
umans=, _to take_; with breaking (§§ 20. 24): =baíra=, =bar=, =bêrum=,
=baúrans=, _to bear_.

  NOTE 1. Like these inflect: =qiman=, _to cum_; =ga-timan=, _to
  suit_; =stilan=, _to steal_; =ga-taíran=, _to tear_; --=brikan=,
  _to break_ (§ 33, n. 1).

  NOTE 2. Here belongs also =trudan=, [=traþ=], [=trêdum=],
  =trudans=, _to tred_ (ON. troða, trað, traðum, troðinn; in OHG.
  according to V.: trëtan, trat, trátum, trëtan). According to
  =trudan=, we should also write =wulan=, _to boil_ (only prsp.
  =wulandans= occurs; Rom. XII, 11).

§ 176. Class V. Verbs of the fifth ablaut series: =i=
(=aí=)--=a=--=ê=--=i= (=aí=) (cp. § 34); e. g., =mita=, =mat=, =mêtum=,
=mitans=, _to mezure_; =giba=, =gaf=, =gêbum=, =gibans=, _to giv_.

  NOTE 1. Here belong also =wrikan=, _to persecute_; =rikan= (found
  in the prs. only), _to accumulate_; =ligan=, _to lie_; =ga-wigan=,
  _to move_; =saíƕan=, _to see_ (cp. § 34, n. 1); --=hlifan=, _to
  steal_; --=bigitan=, _to get, obtain_; =sitan=, _to sit_; =fitan=,
  _to bear_ (_children_)?; =widan=, _to bind_; =qiþan=, _to say_;
  =niþan=, _to help_ (?); --=lisan=, _to gather_; =ga-nisan=, _to
  recuver_; =wisan=, _to remain_.

  NOTE 2. =sniwan=, _to hasten_, has =sniwa=, =snau= (§ 42),
  =snêwum=, =sniwans=. Onse occurs the prt. =snauh= (with additional
  =h=; cp. § 62, n. 4), onse =sniwun= for =snêwun= (§ 7, n. 3).--Like
  =sniwan= inflects probably =diwan=, _to die_, of which only the pp.
  (=þata=) =diwanô= occurs.

  NOTE 3. The prt. sg. of =itan= is, irregularly, =êt=, not =at=;
  only the cpd. =frêt= (< =fra-itan=, _to eat up_; § 4, n. 1; § 7, b)
  is extant. Hense =itan=, =êt=, =êtum=, =itans=. Cp. the OHG. prts.
  âz frâz (ahd. gr., § 343, n. 5), ON. át. Möller, 'Engl. Studien',
  3, 154.

  NOTE 4. The =n= of =fraíhnan=, _to ask_, occurs only in the prs.
  stem: =fraíhna=, =frah=, =frêhum=, =fraíhans= (cp. § 206, b).

  NOTE 5. The =j= in =bidjan= occurs in the prs. stem only: =bidja=,
  =baþ=, =bêdum=, =bidans= (cp. § 206, n.). Onse the prs. is found
  without =j=: =usbida=; Rom. IX, 3.

§ 177. Class VI. Verbs of the sixth ablaut series: =a--ô--ô--a= (cp. §
35); e. g., =slaha=, =slôh=, =slôhum=, =slahans=, _to strike_.

  NOTE 1. Like =slahan= go: =sakan=, _to quarrel_; =wakan=, _to
  wake_; =dragan=, _to carry, load_; =þwahan=, _to wash_; =hlaþan=,
  _to load_; =ga-daban=, _to becum, fit_; =ga-draban=, _to hew_;
  =graban=, _to dig_; =skaban=, _to shave_; =alan=, _to grow_;
  =malan=, _to grind_; =swaran=, _to swear_; =faran=, _to fare, go_;
  =us-anan=, _to expire_. Sum of these verbs occur only in the prs.:
  =wakan=, =dragan=, =alan=, =malan=, =faran=.

  NOTE 2. Sum verbs of this class hav =j= in the present stem,
  which is wanting in the prt. and pp.; e. g., =hafjan=, _to heav_,
  forms: =hafja=, =hôf=, =hôfum=, =hafans=. So do: =fraþjan=, _to
  understand_; =hlahjan=, _to laf_; =skapjan=, _to shape, make_;
  =skaþjan=, _to do scath, to injure_; =wahsjan=, _to wax, grow_.
  Doutful is the prs. form =*garaþjan= which is uzually inferd from
  the pp. =garaþana= (Mt. X, 30), _to count_.--Cp. § 206, n.

  NOTE 3. The =n= of =standan= occurs only in the present stem (cp.
  § 206, b): =standa=, =stôþ=, =stôþum=. The pp. =*staþans= (ON.
  staðinn) is wanting; cp. Anz. fda., 14, 286.


2. Reduplicating Verbs.

§ 178. The preterit of the reduplicating verbs is formd by
reduplication only, the radical vowel remaining unchanged. The
reduplication consists of the initial consonant together with the
constant reduplication vowel =aí= (short e; s. § 20); e. g., =haita=,
_I am calld_, prt. =haíhait=; =ƕôpa=, _I boast_, prt. =ƕaíƕôp=. When
the word begins with two consonants, only the first is repeated; e. g.,
=fraisa=, _I tempt_, prt. =faífrais=. The initial combinations =st=,
=sk=, [=sp=], however, ar repeated together; e. g., =(ga-)stalda=, _I
possess_, prt. =staístald=; =skaida=, _I separate_, prt. =skaískaiþ=.
When the word begins with a vowel, only the reduplication vowel is
prefixt; e. g., =auka=, _I increase_, prt. =aíauk=.

The pp. is formd without reduplication: =haitans=, =fraisans=, etc.

§ 179. The reduplicating verbs may be divided into five classes
according to their radical vowels: (1) =a= (=â=). (2) =ê=. (3) =ai=.
(4) =ô=. (5) =au=. Sinse the vowel remains unchanged in the hole verb,
it causes no change of inflection. Therefore the paradim =haitan= (givn
in § 170) is sufficient for all classes.

The preterits of the following reduplicating verbs ar extant:

(1) =haldan=, _to hold_; =falþan=, _to fold_; =staldan=, _to possess_;
--=fâhan=, _to cach_ (prt. =faífâh=, pl. =faífâhum=, pp. =fâhans=),
=hâhan=, _to hang_ (§ 62, n. 2).

(2) =slêpan=, _to sleep_ (concerning the prt., cp. § 78, n. 3).

(3) =af-aikan=, _to deny_; =fraisan=, _to tempt_; =haitan=, _to be
calld_; =laikan=, _to leap_; =maitan=, _to cut off_; =skaidan=, _to
separate_.

(4) =ƕôpan=, _to boast_; =flôkan=, _to lament_.--The inf. belonging to
the prt. =laílôun= (Jo. IX, 28) is probably (according to § 26, n.)
=*lauan=, _to revile_. Cp. § 22, n. 2.

(5) =aukan=, _to increase_.

  NOTE 1. It is tolerably certain that several verbs of which the
  preterit does not occur belong here too: (1) =us-alþan=, _to grow
  old_; =blandan=, _to blend_; =saltan=, _to salt_; =waldan=, _to
  wield, rule_; =ana-praggan=, _to oppress, harass_. (2) =blêsan=,
  _to blow_. (3) =ga-þláihan=, _to cumfurt, caress_. (4) =blôtan=,
  _to wurship_. (5) =stautan=, _to thrust, smite_; =hlaupan=, _to
  run_.

  NOTE 2. =bauan=, _to dwel_, which formerly belongd here according
  to the testimony of other Germanic dialects, has the weak prt.
  =bauaida= and is referd to the third weak conjugation (§ 193)
  also because of the f. =bauains= (§ 103, n. 1). But the 3d pers.
  sg. is =bauiþ= which is stil a form of the strong conjugation.
  The inflection of the Goth. =bnauan=, _to rub_, which occurs only
  onse (=bnauandans=; Lu. VI, 1) can not be determind; its ON.
  correspondence, *bnúa, (g)núa (altisl. gr., § 433; cp. Zs. fdph.,
  17, 250), like the OHG. nûan, niuwan (ahd. gr., § 334, n. 5)
  belongs to the strong inflection; =trauan=, however, follows the
  weak inflection thruout.--Cp. § 26, b.

  NOTE 3. =gaggan=, _to go_, pp. =gaggans=, has lost its prt.
  =*gaígagg=, which is replaced by other forms. Cp. § 207.

  NOTE 4. Insted of =flôkan= the form =flêkan= was formerly uzed on
  account of the isolated prt. =faíflôkun= (according to § 181). That
  this is wrong was shown by Bezzenberger, 'Ueber die =a=-reihe der
  got. spr.', p. 56⁴. Cp. also Gallée, 'Noord en Zuid', 4, 54 et seq.

  NOTE 5. =arjandan= (in Lu. XVII, 7) seems to refer to a red. v.
  =arjan= (_to plow_), w. a =j=-present (206ᵃ); cp. OHG. erien, iar,
  giaran (ahd. gr., § 350, n. 5).


3. Reduplicating Ablaut Verbs.

§ 180. A number of verbs with the stem-vowel =ê= in the present (or
final =ai= in the root) hav the ablaut of the =ê--ô=-series (s. §
36). The prt. has the vowel =ô= and reduplication. In the pp. appears
the same vowel as in the prs. These verbs ar divided into two classes
according to the vowel of the prs.:

§ 181. I. Stems ending in a consonant hav =ê= in the prs.; e. g.,
=lêtan=, _to let_, which has =lêta=, =laílôt=, =laílôtum=, =lêtans=. Of
this kind ar also =grêtan= (=gaígrôt=), _to weep_; =têkan= (=taítôk=),
_to tuch_; =-rêdan= (=raírôþ=), _to counsel_.

§ 182. II. Roots ending in a vowel change the =ê= into =ai= (§ 22).
Here belong: =saian=, _to sow_: =saia=, =saísô=, =saísôum=, =saians=
(concerning other forms, cp. § 22, n. 1; § 170, n. 2), and =waian=
(=waíwô=), _to blow_.

  NOTE. The prt. of =faian=, _to blame_, is not extant; cp. § 22, n.
  2.


II. WEAK VERBS.

§ 183. The formation and inflection of the prt. and pp. of the four
classes of the weak verbs (§ 168) ar alike. The pp. is formd by means
of the suffix =-da-= (nom. m. =-þs=) which is in all classes added to
the verbal stem. The latter varies according to the formativ suffix and
causes in the present forms a considerabl difference of inflection in
the four classes. We first giv the inflection of the prt., which is the
same in all classes.


_1. INFLECTION OF THE WEAK PRETERIT._

§ 184. Paradims: =nasida=, =salbôda=, =habaida=, =fullnôda=. Only one
exampl is necessary to show the inflection.

            INDICATIV.         OPTATIV.

  Sing. 1. =nasi-da=        =nasi-dêdjau=
        2. =nasi-dês=       =nasi-dêdeis=
        3. =nasi-da=        =nasi-dêdi=

  Dual  1. =nasi-dêdu=      =nasi-dêdeiwa=
        2. =nasi-dêduts=    =nasi-dêdeits=

  Plur. 1. =nasi-dêdum=     =nasi-dêdeima=
        2. =nasi-dêduþ=     =nasi-dêdeiþ=
        3. =nasi-dêdun=     =nasi-dêdeina=

What has been said in § 170, n. 4 concerns also the 1st and 2nd pers.
du. optativ.


_2. FIRST WEAK CONJUGATION_ (=-jan=).

§ 185. The verbs of this class hav the formativ suffix =i= which
appears in the present as =j= (inf. =-jan=). This =j= and a following
=i= ar either contracted into =ei= (according to § 44, c and n. 1)
or remain =ji=. Thus we hav two subdivisions: (a) Verbs with short
stem-syllabls; e. g., =nasjan=, _to save_, or verbs in a long vowel;
as, =stôjan=, _to judge_. (b) Verbs with long stem-syllabls ending in a
consonant; e. g., =sôkjan=, _to seek_, and polysyllabic verbs; e. g.,
=mikiljan=, _to praise_.

  ῥυσάσθω; Mt. XXVII, 43 (cp. § 170, n. 3). The 3d pers. pl. would be
  =lausjandau= according to § 192, n. 1.

  NOTE 2. The 2nd pers. sg. imper. =stauei= (inf. =stôjan=) is
  suggested by the prt. =stauida= according to § 26.

§ 187. Further exampls of this very numerous class: (a) 1. verbs with
short stem-syllabls: =waljan=, _to choose_; =ga-tamjan=, _to tame_;
=uf-þanjan=, _to strech_; =warjan=, _to forbid_; =lagjan=, _to lay_;
=us-wakjan=, _to awake_; =satjan=, _to set_; =wasjan=, _to vest,
clothe_; =hazjan=, _to praise_; =huljan=, _to cuver_; 2. stems ending
in a vowel: =taujan= (imper. sg. =tawei=, prt. =tawida=, pp. =tawiþs=),
_to do_; =*straujan=, _to strew_ (only the prt. =strawida= and pp.
=strawiþs= ar extant); =qiujan= (=qiwida=), _to quicken_; =ana-niujan=
(=-niwida=), _to renew_; =siujan=, _to sew_; --concerning =*môjan= (in
=afmôjan=, _to weary_) and =*dôjan= (in =afdôjan=, _to tire out_), s. §
26, a.

(b) verbs with long stems and polysyllabic verbs: =mêljan=, _to write_;
=mêrjan=, _to preach_; =sipônjan=, _to be a disciple_; =hnaiwjan=, _to
abase_; =hrainjan=, _to clean_; =hausjan=, _to hear_; =þiuþjan=, _to
bless_; --=brannjan=, _to burn_; =sandjan=, _to send_; =namnjan=, _to
name_; =andbahtjan=, _to serv_; =glitmunjan=, _to glitter_; =haúrnjan=,
_to blow the horn_.

  NOTE 1. =kaupatjan=, _to buffet_, has the prt. =kaupasta= (without
  =i=; cp. § 75), but the pp. =kaupatiþs= (cp. § 209, n. 1). The
  verbs =lauhatjan=, _to shine_; =swôgatjan=, _to sigh_, occur in the
  prs. only.

  NOTE 2. Sum primary verbs with =j= in the present stem inflect in
  the present like the weak verbs of the first class. In the prt.
  they ar either strong or weak without the formativ suffix =i=. Cp.
  § 206, a (§ 209).

  NOTE 3. Only two verbs assume occasionally forms of the 2nd weak
  conjugation: =hausjan=, _to hear_, beside =hausjôn= (occurs several
  times); pp. =un-beistjôþs=, _unlevend_, but =ga-beistjan=, _to
  leven_.

  NOTE 4. Like the 2nd pers. du. and pl. imper. of =nasjan= go the
  interjectional =hirjats=, =hirjiþ=. The sg. =hiri= is irregular.
  Cp. § 219.

§ 188. Verbs of this class ar derived from verbs, adjectivs and
substantivs. Their meaning is predominantly causativ. Causativs from
strong ablaut verbs hav the vowel of the prt. sg.; e. g., =wandjan=,
_to wend, turn_ (< =windan=); =dragkjan=, _to giv to drink_ (<
=drigkan=); =ur-raisjan=, _to raiz_ (< =ur-reisan=, _to arize_);
=ga-drausjan=, _to cause to fall_ (< =driusan=).--Also verbs derived
from adjectivs and substantivs show, with few exceptions, a causativ
meaning; e. g., =háuhjan=, _to make high_ (< =háuhs=); =hailjan=, _to
heal_ (< =hails=); =warmjan=, _to warm_ (< =warms=); --=dailjan=, _to
deal_ (< =dails=); =taiknjan=, _to make a sign, to show_ (< =taikns=,
_a token_); etc.--Only a few hav an intransitiv meaning, e. g.,
=sipônjan=, _to be a disciple_; =faúrhtjan=, _to fear_.


_3. SECOND WEAK CONJUGATION_ (=-ôn=).

§ 189. The formativ suffix (=ô=) occurs in this class not only in
the prt., but also in the hole prs., and absorbs the initial vowels
appearing in the endings of the strong verb. Paradim: =salbôn=, _to
anoint_.

_4. THIRD WEAK CONJUGATION_ (=-an=).

§ 191. Verbs of this class hav the formativ suffix =-ai=. This,
however, appears in all forms of the prt. (and in the pp.), while it
occurs in but few forms of the present and what belongs to the prs.,
the greater number following entirely the present forms of the strong
verb. The =ai= is found in the present only where the terminations of
the strong verb begin with =i= which it absorbs (thus, in the 2nd and
3d pers. sg. indic., in the 2nd pers. pl. indic., and in 2nd pers. pl.
imper.), and in 2nd pers. sg. imper. (which has no termination).--But
the =ai= is entirely wanting before the endings beginning with =a=
(=ô=).

  conjugation only: =liugandau=, γαμησάτωσαν; I. Cor. VII, 9.

§ 193. Verbs of this class ar mostly intransitiv. Their number is
comparativly small. Exampls: =þahan=, _to be silent_; =þulan=, _to
suffer_; =liban=, _to liv_; =ana-silan=, _to be silent_; =fijan=,
_to hate_; =trauan=, _to trust_ (cp. § 26); =saúrgan=, _to sorrow_;
=liugan=, _to marry_.

  NOTE. =hatan=, _to hate_, fluctuates between this and the 1st weak
  conj. (=hatjan=); --=bauan=, _to dwel_, has the 3d pers. sg. prs.
  indic. strong: =bauiþ=; cp. § 179, n. 2.


_5. FOURTH WEAK CONJUGATION_ (=-nan=).

§ 194. By means of the suff. =-no-= in the prt., =n= (=-na-=) in the
present, verbs ar formd in Gothic which denote an entering into a
state; therefore they hav an 'inchoativ' meaning. When they hav a
medial meaning, they often also render Greek medio-passiv verbs. These
verbs ar always intransitiv and never hav a purely passiv meaning.
Hense, for exampl, =andbindada= means _it is loost_ (by sum one), but
=andbundniþ=, _it becums loose, it loosens_. Nearly all of these verbs
ar derived from adjectivs or from the stem of the pp. passiv. Exampls:
(a) from strong verbs: =and-bundnan= (=bindan=), _to loosen_ (intr.);
=us-bruknan= (=brikan=), _to break off_ (intr.); =dis-kritnan=, _to
rend_ (intr.); =fra-lusnan= (=fra-liusan=), _to perish_; =ga-waknan=
(=wakan=), _to awaken_; =ga-skaidnan= (=skaidan=), _to becum parted, to
depart_; --(b) from adjectivs: =gahailnan= (=hails=), _to becum hole_;
=mikilnan= (=mikils=), _to becum great_; =weihnan= (=weihs=), _to becum
holy_; =gadauþnan=, _to becum ded, to die_.

  NOTE 1. To substantivs belong =gafrisahtnan= (=frisahts=, _image_),
  _to be formd_; =ga-gawaírþnan= (=ga-waírþi=), _to reconcile one's
  self to_; the stem-vowel is irregular in: =us-geisnan=, _to becum
  amazed_; =in-feinan=, _to be moved with compassion_.

  NOTE 2. That the fundamental meaning of these verbs is inchoativ
  has been shown by Egge, 'Inchoativ or =n=-verbs in Gothic'
  (American Journal of Phil., 7, p. 38 et seq.). The corresponding
  Norse verbs in =-na= ar inchoativ only.

§ 195. The inflection of these verbs is in the present identical with
that of the strong verbs. No medio-passiv nor a pp. can be formd.

III. IRREGULAR VERBS.


_1. PRETERIT-PRESENTS._

§ 196. Preterit-Presents ar strong verbs whose preterit has assumed
a present meaning. In consequence thereof the real presents hav been
lost. These verbs form the preterit like weak verbs by adding =-da=
(=-ta=, =-þa=, =-sa=; cp. §§ 75. 81). Their inflection is the same as
that of =nasida= (§ 184). According to the form of their presents,
the preterit-presents may be distributed among the different classes
of the strong verbs. The prs. inflects like a strong preterit. In the
following the 13 Gothic verbs of this kind ar clast according to the
corresponding ablaut-series:

§ 197. First Ablaut-Series.

1. Prs. =wait=, _I know_, 2nd pers. =waist=, pl. =witum=, opt.
=witjau=; prt. =wissa=, prt. opt. =wissêdjau=, prs. ptc. =witands=,
inf. [=witan=].

2. =lais=, _I know_ (the only form extant; causativ =laisjan=, _to
teach_).

  NOTE. The complete strong verb of =wait= is =*weitan=, =wait=,
  =witum=, =witans=, retaind in =fraweitan=, _to avenge_, and in
  =inweitan=, _to wurship_ (§ 172, n. 1).--To =wait= belongs also a
  weak verb of the III. weak conj., =witan=, =witaida=, _to look at,
  observ_.

§ 198. Second Ablaut-Series.

3. =daug= (impers., the only form extant), _it is of use, it profits_.

§ 199. Third Ablaut-Series.

4. =kann=, _I know_, 2nd pers. =kant= (also =kannt=; cp. § 80), pl.
=kunnum=; prt. indic. =kunþa=, prt. opt. =kunþêdjau=, pp. =kunþs=,
_known_; inf. =kunnan=; prsp. =kunnands=.

5. =þarf=, _I need, be in want of_, 2nd pers. =þarft=, pl. =þaúrbum=,
opt. =þaúrbjau=; prt. =þaúrfta=, pp. =þaúrfts=, _necessary_, prsp.
=þaúrbands=, _needing_, inf. [=þaúrban=].--Cp. § 56, n. 3.

6. =ga-dars=, _I dare_, pl. =ga-daúrsum=, opt. =gadaúrsjau=; prt.
=gadaúrsta=; inf. =gadaúrsan=.

  NOTE. Like =kann= inflect its cpds.: =frakann=, _I despise_;
  =gakann=, _I subject myself_.--With this must not be confounded
  the derivativ weak verb =-kunnan= of the III. weak conjug.,
  =-kunnan=, =-kunnaida=, _to recognize_, in the cpds.: =anakunnan=
  (ἀναγιγνώσκειν), _to read_; =atkunnan=, _to grant, award_;
  =gakunnan=, _to know, consider, read_ (Mk. XII, 26).--=uf-kunnan=,
  _to recognize, know_, belongs in the prs. and pp. (=ufkunnaiþs=) to
  the III. weak conjug., but its prt. is =ufkunþa=, onse (I. Cor. I,
  21) =ufkunnaida=.

§ 200. Fourth Ablaut-Series.

7. =skal=, _I shal_, 2nd pers. =skalt=, pl. =skulum=, opt. =skuljau=;
prt. =skulda=, opt. =skuldêdjau=, pp. =skulds=, _owing_; inf.
[=skulan=], prsp. =skulands=.

8. =man=, _I think, suppose_, 2nd pers. [=mant=], pl. =munum=, opt.
=munjau=; prt. =munda=, pp. =munds= (Lu. III, 23); inf. =munan=, prsp.
=munands=.

  NOTE. Like =man= goes =gaman=, _I remember_.--To this belongs also
  =munan=, prt. =munaida=, a derivativ wv. of the III. conjug.

§ 201. Fifth Ablaut-Series.

9. =mag=, _I may, can_, 2nd pers. =magt=, 3d =mag=; dual =magu=,
=maguts=, pl. =magum=, =maguþ=, =magun=, opt. =magjau=; prt. =mahta=,
opt. =mahtêdjau=, pp. =mahts=; inf. [=magan=], prsp. =magands=.

10. =ga-nah=, _it suffices_; =binah=, _it is permitted, it is lawful_.
These impersonal forms and the pp. =binaúhts= ar the only forms extant.
There may be inferd the pl. =-naúhum=; prt. =-naúhta=; inf. =-naúhan=.

§ 202. Sixth Ablaut-Series.

11. =ga-môt=, _I hav_ or _find room_ or _place_, 2nd pers. [=môst=],
pl. [=môtum=], opt. =gamôtjau=, prt. =gamôsta=; inf. [=gamôtan=].

12. =ôg=, _I fear_, 2nd pers. [=ôht=], pl. [=ôgum=], opt. =ôgjau=; prt.
=ôhta=; inf. [=ôgan=]. Causativ =ôgjan=, _to frighten_.

  NOTE 1. To =ôg= belongs an anomalous 2nd pers. sg. imper.: =ôgs=,
  _fear thou!_ The opt. =ôgeiþ= does duty for the corresponding 2nd
  pers. pl.

  NOTE 2. The only extant form of the primary strong verb is the
  negativ prsp. =unagands=, _fearless_.

§ 203. The verb =áih=, _I hav_, belongs to none of the ablaut-series.
Disregarding the want of reduplication, we may, according to its
formation, refer it to a reduplicated prt. like =haíhait= (§ 179,
3). The extant forms ar: 1st and 3d pers. sg. =áih= (onse =aig=),
pl. 1st =aigum= and =áihum=, 2nd =áihuþ= (onse), 3d =aigun=, opt.
sg. 3d =aigi=, pl. 2nd =aigeiþ=, 3d =aigeina=; prt. =áihta=; prsp.
=aigands= (5 times) and =áihands= (onse), inf. =áihan= (only onse, in
=faíráihan=, _to partake_).

  NOTE. In most forms there is a peculiar fluctuation between =g=
  and =h= in such a manner that the =h= is predominant in the sg.
  (=áih=), the =g= in the other forms. Cp. § 66, n. 1; § 79, n. 2.


_2. THE VERBS 'be' AND 'wil'._

§ 204. The old root es-, which is preservd in all Indo-Germanic
languages, occurs in the Gothic substantiv verb only in the present
indic. and opt. The remaining forms ar supplied by the strong verb
=wisan= (§ 176, n. 1). The pp. is wanting (cp. Anz. fda., 14, 286).

  INDIC.: =was=, =wast=, =was=, etc.

  OPT.: =wêsjau=

  NOTE 1. For =ij= (in the opt. and du. pl. indic. prs.) also simpl
  =i= (§ 10, n. 4) is occasionally found; e. g., pl. indic. 1st pers.
  =sium=, 2nd =siuþ=, opt. =siau=, etc. But the ful forms occur far
  more frequently. The comparativly small number of the forms with
  =i= is confined to the epistls (especially in Cod. B) and to the
  gospel of Lu. which also in other respects shows many irregular
  forms (V, 10. VIII, 25. IX, 12. 41. XIV, 31). Of two extant codices
  (II. Cor. VII, 13. Phil. IV, 5. Col. IV, 6. I. Tim. V, 22) one (in
  three cases A) always has the correct form with =j=.

  NOTE 2. Insted of the imper. the opt. forms, sg. =sijais=, =sijai=,
  pl. =sijaiþ=, ar employd. The form =sai= (= Gr. ἔστω), which occurs
  onse in the manuscript, either stands erroneously for =sijai=,
  =siai=, or must, according to Osthoff (Beitr., 8, 311), be regarded
  as interj. =sai=, _'ecce'!_

  NOTE 3. =nist= = =ni ist=, _is not_ (§ 10, n. 2), =þatist= =
  =þata ist=, _that is_, =karist= = =kara ist=, _there is care, it
  concerns_; Jo. X, 12 (§ 4, n. 1).

§ 205. The verb 'wil' has in the present only an opt. which discharges,
however, the function of the indicativ. This present optativ has the
uzual terminations of the prt. opt. Its preterit is weak. The extant
forms ar:--

  PRESENT:   Sg. 1. =wiljau=    2. =wileis=   3. =wili=
             Du. 2. =wileits=
             Pl. 1. =wileima=   2. =wileiþ=   3. =wileina=

  INFINITIV: =wiljan=

  PRSP.:     =wiljands=

  PRET.:     =wilda=   OPT.: =wildêdjau=

  (Inflection like that of =nasida=, § 184.)


_3. IRREGULARITIES._

§ 206. The distinction between the present stem and the preterit
stem of the strong ablaut verbs consists only in the change of the
vowel. The consonantal skeleton of the word remains the same. This was
not always so, for in proethnic Germanic, as in other Indo-Germanic
languages, there existed present formations with additional consonantal
elements. Of these a few remnants stil survive in Gothic, which from a
Gothic point of view must be regarded as irregularities.

(a) Present formations with =j=. The =j= of these formations which in
the present inflect entirely like weak verbs of the I. conjug. (as,
=nasjan=, =sôkjan=), is no formativ suffix and is dropt in the prt.
and pp. The existing exampls ar:--=bidjan= (§ 176, n. 5), =hafjan=,
=fraþjan=, =hlahjan=, =skapjan=, =skaþjan=, =wahsjan= (§ 177, n. 2),
=arjan= (§ 179, n. 5). Cp. also § 209.

(b) Present stems with a final nasal: =keinan= (§ 172, n. 2) and
=fraíhnan= (§ 176, n. 4); --a medial nasal is seen in =standan= (§ 177,
n. 3).

§ 207. The verb =gaggan= belongs, according to its present and pp. and
according to the testimony of the other Germanic languages, to the
reduplicated verbs (§ 179, n. 3). Its prt. is uzually represented by
the defectiv =iddja= which is conjugated like a weak prt.: =iddja=, _I
went_, =iddjês=, =iddja=, etc.; opt. =iddjêdjau=. Onse, however (Lu.
XIX, 12), a weak prt. =gaggida= occurs.

§ 208. =briggan=, _to bring_, is, according to its prs., an ablaut
verb (III), but the prt. (with ablaut) is formd weak: =brâhta= (from
=*branhta=, § 5, b), pp. [=brâhts=].

§ 209. Sum verbs whose present follows the first weak conjug. (in
part perhaps belonging to § 206, a), form the prt. weak, but without
the formativ suffix =i=: =bugjan=, _to buy_, =baúhta=; =brûkjan=,
_to uze_, =brûhta=; =waúrkjan=, _to work_, =waúrhta=; =þagkjan=, _to
think_, =þâhta= (§ 5, b); =þugkjan=, _to seem_, =þûhta= (§ 15, b).
The extant pps. ar:--=baúhts= < =bugjan=, =waúrhts= < =waúrkjan=, the
remaining ones would be =brûhts=, =þâhts=, =þûhts= (§ 75); =þâhts=
occurs in =anda-þâhts=, _cautious, vigilant_; =þûhts= in =háuh-þûhts=,
=mikil-þûhts=, _haughty_.

  NOTE. Cp. also =kaupatjan= (§ 187, n. 1), which has, however, the
  formativ =i= in the pp.




CHAP. VI. PARTICLS.


1. ADVERBS.

§ 210. Adverbs of Manner ar formd from adjectivs. (a) The commonest
adverbial suff. is =-ba= which is added to the stem of the adjectiv.

Thus, from =a=-stems (§§ 123. 124); e. g., =ubilaba=, _evilly_;
=baírhtaba=, _brightly_; from a =ja=-stem (§ 125 et seq.): =sunjaba=,
_truly_.--The original =i-= and =u=-stems (§§ 129-131) also show
here their real stem-endings; e. g., =analaugniba=, _secretly_;
=anasiuniba=, _visibly_; =arniba=, _surely_; =gatêmiba=, _fitly_;
--=harduba=, _hard, severely_; =manwuba=, _redily_; =glaggwuba=,
_accurately_.

  NOTE. =a= for =u= is found onse each in =hardaba=; II. Cor. XIII,
  10 (in Cod. A, =harduba= in B); =glaggwaba=; Lu. XV, 8.--Cp.
  =brôþra-lubô= (in A), § 88ᵃ, n. 2.

§ 211. (b) Another class of adverbs formd from adjectivs hav the suffix
=-ô= which contains the final vowel of the adjectival stem; e. g.,
=galeikô=, _similarly_; =ûhteigô=, _seasonably_; =þiubjô=, _secretly_;
=glaggwô= (beside =glaggwuba=, _accurately_).

  NOTE. The same adverbial ending also in =auftô=, _perhaps_;
  =sprautô=, _quickly_; =missô=, _reciprocally_; =sundrô=,
  _especially_; =unwêniggô=, _unexpectedly_; =ufarô=, _abuv_;
  =undarô=, _below_; =aftarô=, _behind, from behind_.

§ 212. From comparativ adjectivs an adverbial form has developt which
ends in the bare comparativ suffix (=-iz=), =-is=; e. g., =háuhis=,
_higher_; =áiris=, _erlier_; =mais=, _more_; =haldis=, _rather, more_;
=framis=, _further_; =nêƕis=, _nearer_.

  NOTE 1. Without the =i= of the suffix ar formd: =mins= (§ 78, n.
  1), _less_; =waírs=, _wurse_; =þana-seiþs=, _further, more_.

  NOTE 2. With the comparativ suffix =-ôs= appear =sniumundôs=, _more
  speedily_; =aljaleikôs=, _otherwise_.

  NOTE 3. As superlativ adverbs occur the neuter forms =frumist=,
  _first_; =maist=, _most_.

§ 213. Adverbs of Place ar formd either without a suffix or by means of
the suffixes =-þ= (=-d=) and =-drê= to denote motion towards a place;
by means of the suffixes =-r= and =-a= to denote rest in a place; with
the suffixes =-þrô= and =-ana= to denote motion from a place.

  NOTE 1. From pronominal stems ar thus formd the correlativs:

  =ƕaþ=, =ƕadrê=, _wither?_           | =ƕar=, _where_       | =ƕaþrô=, _whense_
  =[þaþ]= (=þadei=, _where, whither_) | =þar=, _there_       | =þaþrô=, _thense_
  =jaind=, =jaindrê=, _thither_       | =jainar=, _yonder_   | =jainþrô=, _thense_
  =aljaþ=, _elsewhere, away_          | =aljar=, _elsewhere_ | =aljaþrô=, _by another way_
                                      | =hêr=, _here_        |

  NOTE 2. Other exampls: (a) 'Whither'? =dalaþ=, _down_; =samaþ=,
  _together_; =iup=, _upwards_; =ût=, _out_; =inn=, _into_. (b)
  'Where'? =dalaþa=, _below_; =iupa=, _abuv_; =ûta=, _out_; =inna=,
  _in_; =faírra=, _far_; =afta=, _behind_. (c) 'Whense'? =dalaþrô=,
  _from below_; =iupaþrô= and =iupana=, _from abuv_; =ûtaþrô= and
  =ûtana=, _from without_; =innaþrô= and =innana=, _from within_;
  =allaþrô=, _from all sides_; =faírraþrô=, _from afar_; =aftana=,
  _from behind_; =hindana=, _from behind, beyond_.

§ 214. Adverbs of Time ar for the most part represented by cases of
substantivs; e. g., =gistradagis=, _to-morrow_; =himma daga=, _to-day_;
=du maúrgina=, _to-morrow_; =ni aiw=, _never_ (acc. of =aiws=, _time_);
=framwigis=, _continually_.

  NOTE. Simpl adverbs of time are rare: =nu=, _now_; =ju=, _alredy_;
  =áir=, _erly_; =simlê=, _onse_; =ufta=, _often_; from pronominal
  stems: =þan=, _then_; =ƕan=, _when?, whenever_; =suman=, _in times
  past_.

§ 215. Other nominal cases than those givn in § 214 ar also uzed as
adverbs; e. g., =landis=, _far away_, lit. '_of land_'; =allis=,
_holely_; =sunja= and =bi sunjai=, _truly_.

§ 216. Questions and Answers ar mostly accumpanied by adverbial
particls. Interrogativ particls ar: =-u= (=niu=, _not?_, § 18, n. 2);
=an=, =nuh=, _then?_; =ibai=, _whether_; =jau= (=ja-u=), _whether_;
=þau=, _perhaps_.--Affirmativ particls: =ja=, =jai=, _yes, truly!_; a
negativ particl is =nê=, _no!_ These particls, however, ar rarely uzed
'alone' as answers, the verb of the question being uzually repeated, in
negativ sentences with the adv. =ni=.

  NOTE. The interrogativ particl =-u= is enclitically attacht to
  the first word of the sentence; as, =skuldu=; e. g., =skuldu ist
  kaisaragild giban=; Mk. XII, 14. In combinations with a prefix the
  =u= is attacht to the prefix; e. g., =galaubjats þatei magjau þata
  taujan?= Mk. IX, 28.


2. PREPOSITIONS.

§ 217. (a) With the Dativ: =alja=, _except_; =af=, _of_; =du=, _to_;
=miþ=, _with_; =us=, _out, out of_; =faúra=, _before_; =fram=, _from_;
=nêƕa=, _near_; =faírra=, _far off_; =undarô=, _under_.

(b) With the Accusativ: =and=, _along_; =þaírh=, _thru, by_; =inuh=,
_without_; =undar=, _under_; =wiþra=, _against_; =faúr=, _for_.

(c) With Dativ and Accusativ: =ana=, _on, upon_; =at=, _at, by_;
=afar=, _after_; =bi=, _by, according to, against, about, concerning_;
=hindar=, _behind, beyond_; =und= w. dat., _for_; w. acc., _unto, to,
until_; =uf=, _under, beneath_; =ufar=, _over, abuv_.

(d) With Genitiv and Dativ: =ufarô=, _over, abuv, upon_.

(e) With Genitiv, Dativ, and Accusativ: =in= w. gen., _on account of,
for ... sake_; w. dat., _in, into, within, among, on, at_; w. acc.,
_in, into, toward, against_, etc. (s. the Glossary).

  NOTE. Also adverbs ar uzed as prepositions with the genitiv; =as=,
  =utaþrô=, =utana=, =hindana=, =innana= (§ 213, n. 2).


3. CONJUNCTIONS.

§ 218. (a) Copulativ: =jah=, _and, also_; =-uh=, _and_ (cp. § 24, n.
2); =nih=, _and not_. (b) Disjunctiv: =aíþþau=, _or_; =andizuh...
aíþþau=, _either ... or_; =jaþþê...jaþþê=, _whether ... or_; =þau=
(=þáuh=), _or_. (c) Adversativ: =iþ=, =þan=, =aþþan=, =akei=, _but,
however_; =ak=, _but_. (d) Causal: =allis=, =auk=, =untê=, =raíhtis=,
_for, because_. (e) Conclusiv: =þanuh=, =þaruh=, =eiþan=, =nu=, =nuh=,

Comparativ: =ƕaiwa=, _how?_; =swê=, _as_; =swaswê=, _so as, as_; =þau=,
(=þáuh=), _than_. (k) Temporal: =swê=, _as, when_; =þan=, =þandê=,
_when, as long as_; =biþê=, =miþþanei=, _while_; =sunsei=, _as soon
as_; =faúrþizei=, _before_; =untê=, =und þatei=, =þandê=, _til, until,
as long as_.

NOTE. Sum of these conjunctions ar uzed also as adverbs. The adverbial
origin of a few is even recognizabl from their form; e. g., =allis=,
=raihtis=, =faúrþizei= (=faúrþis=, adv., _beforehand_).


4. INTERJECTIONS.

§ 219. =ô=, _oh! ah!_; =wai=, _woe!_; =sai=, _behold!_--Interjectional
in meaning ar the sg. =hiri=, the du. =hirjats=, and the pl. =hirjiþ=,
_cum here!_ (cp. § 20, n. 1; § 187, n. 4).

§ 220. THE GOTHS.

(a) The Gothic language is the language of the Gothic peple
(=Gut-þiuda=) which, divided into the two great tribes of the East and
West Goths, figured in history in the time of the great migration.
Together with the fall of the East Gothic kingdom in Italy and of the
West Gothic kingdom in Spain the Gothic nation also past away. Only
scatterd remains of the Goths and their language remaind until the
beginning of the modern era in the Crimea. ('Crimean' or 'Tetraxitic'
Goths.)

  NOTE 1. The Goth. spelling of the name of the Goths as a peple
  is =*Gutans= and =*Gutôs=, with =t=, not with =þ= according to
  J. Grimm's suggestion which is supported by Kremer (Beitr., 8,
  447). Concerning the form, inflection, and etymology of the name
  of the Goths, cp. Zs. fda., 9, 243 et seq.; Grundr., I, 407;
  Wrede, 'Ostg.', 44 et seq.; Beitr., 17, 178 et seq.; Ax. Erdmann,
  folknamnen 'Götar' och 'Goter', Stockholm 1891 (cp. Litbl. 1894,
  249).

  NOTE 2. The current interpretation of the two Lt. names Austro-,
  Ostrogot(h)æ, -i and Wisigot(h)æ, -i, as East Goths and West Goths,
  which dates back to Jordanes, might hold good for the former only;
  the name of the Wisigothæ which ar simply calld also Vesi, Visi,
  has nothing to do with 'west'. Ep. IF., 4, 300 et seq.

  NOTE 3. Concerning the Crimean Goths and the remains of their
  language, s. Zs. fda., 1, 345-366; W. Tomaschek, 'Die Goten in
  Taurien', Wien 1881; Beitr., 11, 563 et seq.; F. Braun, 'Die
  letzten schicksale der Krimgoten'. Program St. Petersburg 1890 (cp.
  Anz. fda. 17, 167 f.).

(b) It was for the Gothic peple that the group of Germanic tribes to
which the Goths belongd has been frequently calld the 'Gothic Group'.
For this there has been recently proposed the name 'Vandilians'
(according to Pliny, 'nat. hist.', IV, 99). The most important of
these Vandilians ar the Goths, the Gepidae, the Vandals, the Burgundi,
the Heruli, and the Rugii. At the beginning of the Christian era their
abodes wer between the Elbe and the Vistula. The languages of these
peples wer closely related. The extant literary remains, however,
except in Gothic, ar very few, and these ar almost entirely proper
nouns.

  NOTE 4. Concerning the Vandilians, cp. F. Wrede, 'Ueber die sprache
  der Wandalen', Strassburg, 1886 (QF., 59), p. 3 et seq.; F. Dahn,
  'Urgeschichte der germ. und rom. völker', vol. I (Berlin 1881), p.
  139 et seq.; R. Much, 'Goten und Ingvaeonen. (Beitr., 17, 178-221).

(c) The Gothic or Vandilian group of tribes together with the
Scandinavians constitute the 'East Germanic' division as opposed to the
'West Germanic' division which embraces the remaining Germanic tribes.

  NOTE 5. Concerning the division of the Germanic race into East
  Germanic and West Germanic tribes, cp. H. Zimmer, 'Ostgermanisch
  und Westgermanisch', in Zs. fda., 19, 393 et seq.; Beitr. 9, 546 et
  seq.; Grundr., I, 362 et seq.; concerning the separate position of
  the Scandinavian as compared with the Gothic, s. Noreen, 'altisl.
  gr.²', § 2, and Grundr., I, 419 et seq.


§ 221. SOURCES OF THE GOTHIC LANGUAGE.

We know the Gothic language from the fragments of the biblical
translation which is safely ascribed to bishop Ulfilas (or, in Gothic
spelling, Wulfila; cp. Bernhardt, Vulfila, p. VII; Anz. fda., 14, 285;
Grundr., II, 67⁴). Wulfila was born in 310 and died at the end of 380
or erly in 381 after Christ. During the last 33 years of his life
he was bishop of that part of the West Goths which, when persecuted
by their heathen kinsmen, he led across the Danube where they wer
permitted by Constantius to setl in Moesia (Moeso-Goths or Goti
minores).--The fragments of the biblical version hav cum down to us in
the following manuscripts:--

1. 'Codex Argenteus' at Upsala. It containd on 330 leavs the four
gospels in the following order: Matthew, John, Luke, Mark. Of these 330
leavs 187 ar extant. The gospel of Lu. shows yunger forms of speech
which differ in many respects from the normal forms (cp. §§ 7, n. 2;
14, n. 3; 56, n. 1; 62, n. 3; 67, n. 2; a 74, n. 1; 105, n. 2; 204,
n. 1; probably thru the influence of the dialect of the East Gothic
writers; cp. Wrede, 'Ostg.', 200 et seq.).

2. 'Codex Carolinus', a 'codex rescriptus' at Wolfenbüttel, which
contains portions of the 11.-15. chaps. of the epistl to the Romans.

3. 'Codices Ambrosiani', five fragments ('codices rescripti') in the
Ambrosian library at Milan, which contain chiefly St. Paul's epistls.
They are clast as follows:--

  Codex A contains on 95 leavs fragments of the epistls to the
    Romans, Corinthians, Ephesians, Galatians, Philippians,
    Colossians, Thessalonians, Timothy, Titus, Philemon, and a
    fragment of a Gothic calendar.

  Codex B contains on 77 leavs all of the second epistl to the
    Corinthians, fragments of the first epistl to the Corinthians, of
    the epistls to the Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians,
    Thessalonians, Timothy, Titus.--In contents Codex A and Codex B
    ar partly the same, which is important for the criticism of the
    text.

  Codex C. Two leavs with fragments of Mt. XXV-XXVII.

  Codex D. Three leavs with fragments of the books of Ezra and
    Nehemiah.

  Codex E. Eight leavs three of which ar in the Vatican library at
    Rome, and contain the fragments of an interpretation of the
    gospel of St. John. They wer calld by their editor (Massmann):
    =Skeireins aíwaggêljôns þaírh Jôhannên=, and are therefore stil
    cited as =Skeireins= (concerning which cp. Zs. fda., 37, 320;
    Anz. fda., 20, 148 et seq.).

4. 'Codex Taurinensis', four considerably damaged leavs with scanty
fragments of the epistls to the Galatians and Colossians, which remain
to be deciferd.

  NOTE 1. Concerning Wulfila, cp. Waitz, 'Ueber das leben und die
  Lehre des Ulfila' (Hannover 1840); Bessell, 'Ueber das leben des
  Ulfilas' (Göttingen 1860); G. Kaufmann, 'Kritische untersuchung
  der quellen zur geschichte Ulfilas', in Zs. fda., 27, 193 et seq.;
  Grundr. II, 68; Kögel, 'Gesch. der dtsch. Litt.', I, 1, 182.

  NOTE 2. For more on the Gothic manuscripts, s. Bernhardt's
  'Vulfila', Introduction, p. XXXIX et seq.; for the history of
  the 'Codex Argenteus', cp. also the recent articls by Schulte,
  'Gotthica minora', in Zs. fda., 23, 51. 318 and 24, 324 et seq.:
  lastly, J. Peters, 'Germania', 30, 314 et seq.

  NOTE 3. Beside the translation of the Bible (and the =Skeireins=)
  there ar no Gothic literary monuments of great moment. The most
  important ones ar two Latin title deeds with Gothic signatures at
  Naples and Arezzo, and the abuv (with Codex A) mentiond fragment
  of a Gothic calendar. The editions of Wulfila contain these
  remains also. Concerning the Gothic words and alfabets in the
  Salzburg-Vienna manuscript (§ 1, n. 5; § 2, n. 2) and other remains
  of the Gothic language, cp. Massmann's articl 'Gotthica minora',
  in Zs. fda., 1, 294-393.--Concerning Gothic runic inscriptions, s.
  Wimmer, 'Die runenschrift' (1887), p. 62 et seq.; R. Henning, 'Die
  deutschen runendenkmäler', Strassburg 1889 (and Zs. fdph., 23, 354
  et seq.; Wimmer, 'de tyske runemindesmærker, Aarb. f. nord. oldk.
  og hist.', 1894, 1 et seq.). The most important inscription is that
  of the Bukarest ring ('gold-ring of Pietroassa', Henning, 27 et
  seq.): =gutaniowi hailag=.

  NOTE 4. The numerous proper nouns in Gothic, which ar containd
  in Greek and stil more so in Latin sources, hav been utilized by
  Dietrich ('Ausspr.') and by Bezzenberger, 'Ueber die A-reihe der
  got. sprache', Göttingen 1874, p. 7 et seq. A monografic treatment
  of the East Gothic names has been givn us by F. Wrede, 'Ueber die
  sprache der Ostgoten in Italien', Strassburg 1891 (OF., 68); cp.
  review of this book in Litbl. 1891, p. 333; Anz. fda., 18, 43 et
  seq., 309 et seq.


§ 222. EDITIONS.

The first printed edition of the 'Codex Argenteus' is that by Fr.
Junius, Dortrecht 1665. All the erlier editions (the titles of which
s. in Bernhardt's 'Vulfila', p. LXIII et seq., and in Balg's 'First
Germanic Bible', p. XVII et seq.; cp. also v. Bahder, 'Die deutsche
philologie', Paderborn 1883, p. 44 et seq.) hav now only historical
value. For the study of the Gothic language the following editions ar
of importance:--

(a) The large edition of Ulfilas by +v. d. Gabelentz+ and +Löbe+,
which appeard in 1843-46 in three volumes 4to. Altho the text in the
first volume is antiquated in consequence of Uppström's editions, the
glossary (vol. II, 1) and particularly the grammar (vol. II, 2) ar of
great value for their abundant compilations and syntactic elaboration.

(b) For an exact establishment of the manuscripts ar exceedingly
important the new readings of the learnd Swedish Professor +Andreas
Uppström+ who issued exact reprints of the text according to these
readings: Codex Argenteus, Upsala 1854,--Decem codicis argentei
rediviva folia, Upsala 1857,--Fragmenta gothica selecta 1861,--Codices
gotici ambrosiani 1864-68.--(For complete titles, s. v. Bahder, loc.
cit.; cp. also Balg, loc. cit.).

(c) A critically amended text based on Uppström's readings, with
critical exegetic notes and the original Greek text, is givn in +E.
Bernhardt's+ edition: 'Vulfila oder die gotische bibel'. Halle 1876.
Cp. review of it in Zs. fdph., 7, 103 et seq.

(d) A good manual of Ulfilas, with a glossary and a grammar, is that
by +M. Heyne+, 8th edition. Paderborn 1885. Its text is likewise based
on Uppström's readings, but it is treated more conservativly than
Bernhardt's. The fonological and inflectional parts of the grammar
rest on antiquated views, but the glossary is a recommendabl handbook
containing all the words of the Gothic language.

  NOTE. Other later editions of the texts ar: (a) +Bernhardt's+,
  Halle 1884 (a reprint of the text of his larger edition, with a
  concise glossary); cp. review of it in Zs. fdph., 17, 249 et seq.
  (b) The first Germanic Bible translated from the Greek by the
  Gothic bishop Wulfila in the fourth century, and the other remains
  of the Gothic language, edited (according to Bernhardt's edition),
  with an introduction, a syntax, and a glossary, by +G. H. Balg+.
  Milwaukee, Wis. 1891.

I. FROM THE GOSPEL OF ST. MATTHEW.

Chap. V, 17. =ni hugjaiþ=; prohibitiv optativ (S., 91, (2)).--=qêmjau=;
opt. in a final object clause (S., 93).--=gataíran=, _to tear_ or
_break completely, destroy_; =usfulljan=, _to fulfil_. Both =gat.=
and =usf.= ar infinitivs of purpose (S., 114), the prefixes =ga=
and =us= being intensiv. 18. =usleiþiþ himins jah aírþa=; two subj.
nominativs with a sg. v. (S., 5, n. 1). 19. =saei=; rel. prn. (Gr.,
157; S., 60).--=þizô=; dem. prn., not art. (S., 63).--=gataíriþ=
(prs. ind.) =.....laisjai= (prs. opt.); the first denoting a fact,
the second a possibility (S., 99, c): _whosoever breaks and 'should'
teach_.--=minnista=; an exceptional case of a weak adj. without the
art.--=þiudangardjai himinê=; without the art. (in the Grk. text
τῇ....τῶν).

20. =managizô= (n. compar. uzed as sb.) =izwaraizôs garaíhteins=,
_more of your righteousness than of [the righteousness of] the
scribes_.--=þau= (conj.), _than_ =...þau= (adv.), _in any case_;
=ni þau=, _in no case_.--=qimiþ in þiudangardjai=; the dativ after
=qiman in= and similar vs. of 'motion towards' is distinctivly Gothic
(S., 55). 21. =qiþan ist=; stands for the Grk. aor. (S., 87, n., c)
= imperf. in English.--=maúrþrjais=; the hort. opt. for the second
pers. fut. in Grk.--=waírþiþ=; the prs. for the Grk. fut. (S., 86,
(3)).--=skula= w. dat., _a detter_ or _subject to_ (S., 35, (2)). 22.
=ik=; the personal prn. is uzed with a v. for the sake of emfasis (S.,
2, n. 1).--=ƕazuh môdags=; for πᾶς ὁ w. a ptc.--=brôþr seinamma=; dat.
after =môdags=: _angry with_ (lit. '_to_'; S., 36, (3)).--=gaqumþai=,
_council_, from =gaqiman=, _to cum together_.--=dwala= (voc.); weak
adj. uzed as sb.--=skula in gaíaínnan=; =in= denoting 'direction'
'in regard to'; the expression seems to be an imitation of the
corresponding Grk. passage: ἔνοχος ἔσται εὶς τὴν γέενναν.

23. =jabai nu baírais...gamuneis= (Gr., 200, n. 1; and 196); a
conditional sentence, the vs. of the protasis being in the opt.,
those of the apodosis in the imper. (S., 102, e).--=aibr=; s.
'Vocabulary'.--=þeins=; attributes generally follow their sb. (S.,
10, n. 2).--=ƕa=; here indef. (Gr., 162, n. 2; S., 78, n. 2). 24. Here
the apodosis begins.--=þô=; the art. is uzed, because the sacrifice
(=aibr=) is again mentiond (as =giba=) (S., 67).--=þeina=; for its
strong inflection, s. Gr. 122, n. 1.--=brôþr þeinamma=; dat. after
=gasibjôn= (S., 43). 25. =andastauin þeinamma=; dat. after =waíla
hugjands= (S., 41).--=ibai=, _lest_, lit. _perhaps_, which sense is
also exprest by the opt. =atgibai=.--=stauin=; from =staua=, m. (Gr.,
108; not f.; Gr., 97).--=in karkara gal.=; =gal. in= w. acc., more
frequently w. dat.; see =qimiþ in=, abuv; =jah galagjaza=, _and [then]
thou wilt be cast_. 26. =usgaggis..usgibis=; the first prs. expresses
the first, the second the past future.--=minnistan=; this word does
not exactly answer ἔσχατον (which Wulfila in other places renders by
=aftuma=, =aftumists=, =spêdiza=, =spêdists=, =spêdumists=). It is not
impossibl, however, that =kintus= ment not one particular coin (or
mezure), but any coin (or mezure) of litl value.

27. For the tenses and opt. mood, see 21, abuv. 28. =saei saíƕiþ=;
ind. in a rel. clause for a Grk. ptc. (S., 99).--=du lustôn=; inf.
of purpose after =du= (S., 144).--=izôs=; gen. after =lustôn=
(S., 26).--=gahôrinôda= (For the Grk. aor.; S., 87, (3)) =izai=;
instrumental dat. of association (S., 52, (1), c). 29. =marzjai=;
opt. necessitated by the sense, not by the conj. =jabai= (S.,
102).--=usstigg ita jah waírp=; the order of words is Grk.; in Engl.
we repeat the object 'it' after the second v. (=waírp=).--=gadriusai
in gaíaínnan=; =gadr. in= w. acc.; onse (Lu. 8, 7) it takes the dat.;
comp. =qiman in=, chap. V, 20, abuv. 30. =taíhswô þeina handus=; comp.
the sequence of words (without the art.) with the similar expression
(with the art.) in 29, abuv.--=þô=, _this, that_; but αὐτήν in
Grk.--=batizô ist þus ei=, etc.; the dependent clause after =batizô
ist= is sumtimes an acc. w. inf. (S., 113); =þus= is dat. of advantage
(S., 36, (4)).--=fraqistnai....gadriusai=; both optativs imply
possibility (S., 103). 31. =-uh þan=; both particls (= =þan= alone)
ar here continuativ: _but farther, also_.--=saei aflêtai qên=; opt.
in a rel. clause which does not contain a statement of the speaker,
but of sum one else (cp. verse 32, below); =qên= is less definit
here than in the following verse, where =seina= is emfatic, and =qên
seina= means as much as '_his legitimate wife_'.--=gibai=; hort. opt.
(S., 91, (2)).--=afstassais bôkôs=, _a writing_ (lit. _letters_; cp.
the Latin 'littera': 'litterae') _of divorcement_ (lit. '_standing
off_'; cp. the G. 'abstand' in the sense of 'desistence'). 32. =saei
aflêtiþ.....taujiþ=; the vs. ar in the ind. mood, because they contain
the speaker's statements (as opposed to the preceding ones).--=izê=;
for =izei= (Gr., 157, n. 3). 33. =ufarswarais...usgibais=; hort. opt.
(S., 91, (2)).--=fraujin=; without the articl, when signifying _God_
(S., 68, n. 2. The Grk. text has τῷ). 34. =swaran=; objectiv inf. after
=qiþan=, _to say_, with the sense of 'commanding' (S., 110).--=guþs=;
gen. in its abbreviated form (Gr., 94, n. 3). 35. =baúrgs=; without
the art., as in Grk. 36. =tagl=, _a singl hair_; =skuft=, _the hairs_
collectivly. 37. =sijaiþ-þan= (for =sijaih þan=, for =sijai-uh þan=;
see Gr., 62, n. 3), _but ... shall be_.--=þata= (art.) =managizô=; n.
compar. uzed as sb.: lit. '_the more_', i. e. _what is more_.--=þaim=;
dat. as abl. (S., 54, 3), after the compar. =managizô= (= =þau= w.
nom.; cp. the Grk. gen. and the Lt. abl. in such cases).--=ubilin=;
dat. of the n. sg. =ubilô= uzed as sb. 38. =und=, _for, in return
for_, w. dat.; in other senses, and more frequently, w. acc. 39.
=andstandan=; inf., as in verse 34.--=allis=; adverbial gen., from the
adj. =alls=, _at all_, without equivalent in the Grk. text. Wulfila
probably inserted it according to verse 34, where the Grk. text shows
ὅλως.--=þamma unsêljin=; weak adj. n. uzed as sb.; see =ubilin= in 37,
abuv.--=ƕas=; here indef., as in 23, abuv.--=stautai=; opt., as in 29,
abuv; likewise the imper. =wandei= in the apodosis.--=jah=, _also_.
40. =jah=, _and_.--=þamma wiljandin=; a participial construction, as
in Grk. (τῷ θέλοντι).--=niman=; complimentary inf. after =wiljandin=
(as in 42, below; S., 109). 41. =ananauþjai..gaggais=; the prs. opt.
in protasis and apodosis (S., 102, a).--=rasta aina=; acc. expressing
extent of space (S., 15, (2), β); =rasta= (for μίλιον, the Roman
_mile_), lit. _'rest', place of resting, a stage or station_, also
_the distance between two stages_. 42. =þamma wiljandin=; dat. as
abl. after =uswandjais= (S., 54, (1), where =us= should be inserted
after =af=).--=leiƕan= (complementary inf.; S., 109) =sis=, _to
borrow_; =leiƕan=, _to lend_. 43. =frijôs...fiais fiand.....frijôþ
fijands=; these words and several others ar found both with and
without =j= (Gr., 10, n. 4); =fiand= (=fijand=), acc. of =fiands=
(=fijands=), _enemy_, lit. _hating_, prsp. of =fi(j)an=, _to hate_
(Gr., 115). 44. =þiuþjaiþ þans wrikandans=; _bless ye_ (= _treat wel_;
for the dat. after =þiuþjan=, s. S., 45, page 246, below).--=bi=,
_concerning, for_.--=usþriutandans=; acc. of the prs. ptc. (Gr., 133)
of =usþriutan=, the =us-= being intensiv; =-þriutan= = '-trude' in
'obtrude'. 45. =ei waírþaiþ sunjus=; =ei=, _that, in order that_;
=waírþaiþ=, prs. opt. in a final clause (S., 96, a).--=in himinam=;
adv. frase uzed substantivly after the art. (=þis=).--=urranneiþ=;
=ur-= from =us=; Gr., 24, n. 2; 78, n. 4.--=rigneiþ=; from =rignjan=,
factitiv of =rign=, n., _rain_. 46. =ƕô mizdônô=; the interr. =ƕô=
agrees with the following gen. in gender.--=niu= (i. e. =ni-u=);
interr. particl.--=þai þiudô=, _the (= those) of the Gentiles_, =
_the Gentiles_; =þiudô= is gen. pl. of =þiuda=, _peple_. 47. =þans
frijônds izwarans=, _the frends (of) yours, = your frends_; =frijônds=
is sb. in form (Gr., 115) and meaning, while =þans frijôndans= stil
has its verbal force; =izwarans= is a poss. prn. acc. pl. agreeing
with =frijônds=, but =izwis= is a personal prn. acc. pl. guvernd by
=frijôndans=.--=ƕê=; instr. case of =ƕa=, n. of =ƕas= (Gr., 159; S.,
51).--=managizô=; compar. after =ƕê= (S., 51). 48. =jus=; for the
personal prn. with a vb., see verse 22, abuv.--=swaswê atta izwar sa in
himinam= is the subject, not =sa=, =sa in himinam= being an attribute
of =atta izwar=, and may be renderd by a rel. clause in English.

Chap. VI. 1. =taujan=; complimentary inf. after =atsaíƕiþ= (2nd pers.
pl. imper.).--=du saíƕan im= prop. a gerundiv construction, _to be
seen by them_, lit. '_for them to see_'. The activ inf. in Gothic
often has a passiv force (S., 106, n. 3, end).--=aiþþau=, _or else,
otherwise_. 2. =þan=, _when_.--=taujais=; opt. in a temporal clause
(S., 100).--=haúrnjais=; hort. opt. (S., 91, (2)).--=þai liutans=; the
art. denotes a class of peple (S., 68, (6), n.).--=háuhjaindau=; prs.
opt. pass. in a final clause (S., 96, a, α).--=fram=, _by_.--=qiþa=;
without =ik=; see V, 22, abuv.--=andnêmun=; pret. expressing completion
(= our prs. perf.): _they hav receivd_ (Cp. 5, below). 3. =þuk
taujandan armaiôn ni witi hleidumei þeina, ƕa taujiþ taíhswô þeina=;
a puzling construction, indeed! (Cp. O. Luecke, 'Absolute Participia
im Gotischen, etc.'; and E. Bernhardt, 'Gotische Grammatik', p. 116).
Sum Latin manuscripts hav 'te facientem'. But =þuk taujandan= probably
depends on =witi=: _Let not thy left hand know thee doing alms, what
thy right hand doeth_ (= _when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand
know what thy right hand doeth_.) 4. =sijai=; prs. opt. in a final
clause (S., 96, a).--=saíƕiþ=; ind. in a rel. clause expressing a fact

seen by_' = '_to appear_' or '_show one's self to_').--=þatei haband=,
etc.; cp. =andnêmun=, etc., in 2, abuv. 6. =haúrdai þeinai=; instr.
dativ after =galûkands= (S., 52, (4), note). 7. =bidjandansuþ=; =s=
before the enclitic =-uh= (=-uþ=; Gr., 62, n. 3) generally becums
=z= (Gr., 78, c).--=þai þiudô=; gen. after the art. in the nom.;
see V, 46.--=im=; dat. (of the pers. prn. =is=) after the impers.

simply in apposition with the preceding dat. =unsis=.--=þizei= (=ei=
for =ê=. Gr., 7, n. 2); gen. pl. of the art. before the following two

the Gothic text. Perhaps it is ment to connect =gamanwida=, etc.,

heven), then the second =jah= means _also_; or =jah..jah= = _both ...

  TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES


  PM. Note: Balg's translation is a bit awkward. He knew quite a
  number of languages so well that he wrote books about them, but he
  had is own view of English orthography. He frequently left out "e"
  when the "e" was not pronounced, like in "ar" (for "are"), "hav",
  "givn" etc. He did this consistently, so this was his deliberate
  choice.

  On p. x the reference "Brugm., Grundriss der vergleichenden
  grammatik der indog. sprachen von K. Brugmann (Engl. edition).
  Strassburg 1886-92" is the German ed.; the English one, to which
  refs. in this book apply, is _Elements of the Comparative Grammar
  of the Indo-Germanic Languages_, New York 1888-95.

  The characters used in the table on p. 11 are approximations of

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
